And that's because on issue after issue that the American people care about, Joe Biden has failed the American people. People are worn out, and they're worried for themselves and their families. They understand that their lives have been made worse by Joe Biden and the Democrats. People are begging for solutions. What we're likely to hear is the president bragging about Bidenomics and blaming others for the crisis that he has created at the border.

Super easy. I'm sure all of you guys know it's totally easy to own a car wash. And that's about it. And on the male stripper note, I walk into the bank like this with a ton of money. So this time I'm going to explain to you how I collect and process the money before I go to the bank. And this is how I do it. So I organize everything and put it through my cheap money counter from Amazon. And it works alright until I have to press reset like 2 times when the fives are going through because it kind of sucks sometimes. But it's better than counting by hand. So after that, I go through all the money. If I have coins that week, I will take them by weight. And the bank gives me these nice bags and I pour the coins into the bag. And that's how we get to deposit the coins. And after that, it's pretty simple. I put the money into these bags, pack it up tight, bring it into my bank. Everyone asks me what I do for a living to have this much cash and I say, I'm a male stripper."

That's why they can do a liver transplant on just a little bit of liver and the liver will regrow. And I'm so glad that God made the liver a recoverable organ because some of the things that people are doing to their body, in ignorance, mostly granted, if we didn't have a recoverable organ, some of us wouldn't even live past our 20s. And these herbs help stimulate the liver to regrow and to recover. Cancer cannot get a hold on the body if the liver is working in optimum performance. And one liver herb that many people don't realize it is, is the lemon. So a great drink in the morning, remember you wake up, have your water, have another bit of water, and then when you come near the kitchen, have the kettle boiled and put the juice of a lemon in some water with a little bit of boiling water on top and have a warm lemon drink. Fantastic liver tonic early in the morning. Also, the lemon is an internal alkalizer so that will do a few things too."

I feel like this shade family is too light. This one might work. That's too dark. Okay, so it's this one. Look for the swatch that just immediately blends in. For me, it's obviously the cool tone.

Now Catwoman was on vacation with her friends in Mykonos, and one night they all stay out late partying. And while they're walking back to their Airbnb, Catwoman hears a song playing in a nearby bar. And she loves this song. Oh my God, I literally ran in and started dancing. Also at that same bar is this guy, who we'll call Greek. And Greek is making his way through that bar, and that's when this moment happens. ‚ô™ I'm just gonna date myself. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I don't like anyone else. ‚ô™ But unfortunately it's late, Catwoman's friends are bugging her to leave, and she's intoxicated, so she does. And about a week goes by, and Catwoman is back in Malaysia from her vacation. And she's forgotten all about that drunken night and this moment, until she starts looking at some of the vacation footage. And that's where she really notices Greek, like, damn, he kind of fine. I was like, sis, were you blind? He could be the one. I could be with a Greek man right now. So she takes the video of this moment and posts it to TikTok, and captions it asking the internet to help find him. And that video blows up like 16 million views. But unfortunately, nobody knows who he is."

The state's complex fault system, particularly the San Andreas Fault, continues to be a major concern for seismic activity. According to the USGS, there is a 72% chance of a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake striking the San Francisco Bay Area before March. Number 2. Tennessee. This state is part of the New Madrid Seismic Zone, a region of high seismic activity in the central US. This zone is caused by an ancient rift in the crust that has been reactivated by plate motions and glacial rebound. The USGS predicts that there is a 7-10% chance of a magnitude 6 or greater earthquake occurring in this zone in the next 50 days. Before revealing the number 1, remember to subscribe and like the video. Number 1. Alaska. This state is situated on a major plate boundary, where the Pacific Plate is subducting under the North American Plate. This process generates a lot of friction and heat, which can cause volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. The USGS estimates a 12% chance of an earthquake in Alaska soon. And you? Are you in one of these states and are you taking caution now? Let me know in the comments."

It was founded more than 4,000 years ago and is located in modern-day Iraq on the lower Euphrates River in southern Mesopotamia. And it's known for building one of the seven wonders of the world, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. It had layers of gardens going up of a huge variety of trees, shrubs, and vines and was on a green mountain of mud bricks. This thing was huge. It was also the place where they believed the Old Testament story of the Tower of Babel happened. Where, you know, they were trying to build the huge tower to reach heaven and then God made them all speak different languages and they couldn't finish it. In modern-day, after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the U.S. built a military base on the ruins of Babylon, which was said to cause major damage to the archaeological site.

They're perfectly crisp on the outside, gooey on the inside and also so easy to make because we're using melted butter. I was heavy into overnight cookie dough where you chill cookie dough overnight to get the most flavor and texture. And when I was making these, I wanted to challenge myself to get that flavor and texture without the weight. And oh my gosh, my dog, she's so freaking adorable. But anyway, somehow we nailed it by using the most basic ingredients, flour, butter, sugar, vanilla, and the best chocolate chips. I ran a little experiment last year to find the best chocolate chips for chocolate chip cookies and these Trader Joe's semi-sweet won out by a landslide. Now there's a few tricks that elevate these chocolate chip cookies and first is our scooper. Using a large ice cream scoop creates a variety of textures in your cookies and then top with chocolate chips before baking. Pull them out of the oven when the center still looks a little underdone. Trust me, once they cool, that center will set into this ooey gooey texture, top with sea salt and they are perfect."

First, it is very important that your butter is at room temperature. And as for the pan, it is best to use a medium, heavy bottom sauce pan so your caramel doesn't burn. First, we're gonna heat the sugar over medium heat, and this will take a little bit longer if you're using an electric stovetop. And while we wait for that to heat up, I'm gonna warm our cream as well. After a few minutes, the sugar will slowly start to melt, and we'll kinda wanna nudge it around just for even browning. Very quickly, that sugar will darken, so immediately take it off the heat and mix in the butter. This is why it's important the butter's at room temperature and the cream is warm, otherwise, if you add cold ingredients to hot sugar, it'll just all try to harden up. And once it's chilled, it'll thicken into the perfect consistency.

We've used Rogaine enough as an example where women's Rogaine at 5% is way overpriced compared to men's Rogaine at 5%. They may look similar in pricing but you're only getting a third of the quantity as a woman versus as a man. CVS is another example. Here they appear to be doing better right because they write that you're gonna get a six-month supply for $55.99 as a woman. As a man getting a six-month supply you're paying $80.99 but the difference here they're getting double the amount. They're getting six cans versus women only getting three cans. So stop paying the pink tax. As a woman you can use 5% minoxidil on your hair even though it's marketed for the men and you will save money in the process. Is that the alarm?

It has been an incredibly tough couple of months for our entire family but I've had a fantastic medical team who've taken great care of me for which I'm so grateful. In January I underwent major abdominal surgery in London and at the time it was thought that my condition was non-cancerous. The surgery was successful however tests after the operation found cancer had been present. My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy and I'm now in the early stages of that treatment. This of course came as a huge shock and William and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family. As you can imagine this has taken time. It has taken me time to recover from major surgery in order to start my treatment but most importantly it has taken us time to explain everything to George, Charlotte and Louis in a way that's appropriate for them and to reassure them that I'm going to be okay.

New York is known for their crumb cake, but I'm from the Midwest, so I call it coffee cake. But it doesn't matter what you call it, because it's delicious either way.

7348162190538542379,"My husband woke up craving chocolate brownies the other day, so I started by cutting open some cacao pods and taking out the beans. Then I wrapped them up to ferment for 8 days, during which I mixed them each day and put them in a cooler with warm water each night to help keep the fermentation going. After 8 days, they were perfectly fermented, so I laid them out in the sun until they were all dry, which took about 12 days. Next, I roasted them in the oven and then removed the shells. This part is so satisfying. And then I poured the beans into my wet grinder along with some raw sugar and let them grind for about 48 hours. At one point, I held a blow dryer on there to help release the cocoa butter from the beans. And eventually, we had beautiful liquid chocolate. It was still very thick for a variety of reasons, which made it pretty hard to temper. So some of the bars were bloomed, which looks like this. But it didn't matter because I was melting them for brownies. So the next day, I chopped up some of my fresh chocolate and melted it with brown butter in the microwave until it was all nice and melty. Then I cracked 3 eggs into a bowl, added some sugar, and whisked until it was nice and fluffy. From there, I added in flour and a little bit of cocoa powder. And then I folded in my melted chocolate and butter. Lastly, I added some chopped fresh chocolate and then I poured this into a pan and baked for about 25 minutes. And my husband was so excited. He said he's been craving these for 3 weeks, which is how long it took to make them. So we ate them hot out of the oven, topped with vanilla ice cream, olive oil, and flaky salt. They had the perfect texture and the perfect chocolate flavor. And I'm 100% serious, they were the best brownies we've ever had."

It's not necessarily because they have better eyelid skin than you, they just have access to some really good Korean beauty treatments. I've seen a few reviews of this, and people are claiming it instantly freshen up their eyes. I don't know how that's possible, but let's try it. Did you know the skin around your eyes can be less than 1mm thick, making it the thinnest skin on your entire body? For this reason, you have to be super careful what you use on your eyes. Alright, in all seriousness, I definitely feel a difference with this on, and the texture and formulation of this eye serum gives you an immediate cosmetic payoff. Take a look at this before and after, showing how it immediately brightens the eye area. With long-term use, you'll also notice improvement in dark circles, fine lines, and puffiness. Go look up vegan collagen eye serum right now. And comment below what you think about Korean skincare."

Hi doctor, I think I might be autistic. Oh, you're not autistic because you're not a white boy. Maybe we should look into bipolar disorder. Hey mom, I think I might be autistic. No, you're not autistic. I have all the same traits as you. I was just like you when I was younger. You're not autistic because I do the same things and I'm definitely not autistic. Hi counselor, um can I talk to you for a second? I think that I might be autistic and I'm not really getting any help with it. It is extremely disrespectful that you think that you're autistic. I have a nephew that is autistic and you are nothing like them. Everybody wants to be autistic nowadays for special treatment but real autistic people are the ones that are actually suffering and have a disability.

There has recently been an increase of migrants from China coming to the US. The journey of a Chinese migrant is a lot different from a migrant from South America. The main reason being is that it is against the law for a Chinese citizen to leave China, unless it is for what Chinese law calls private business. Private business means residing, visiting relatives, visiting friends, inheriting properties, going abroad to study at own expense, obtaining employment, making a tour or other private affairs. Simply leaving your country doesn't qualify as private business. And the Chinese president even banned the exit of tens of thousands of people at one time. And the journey is not cheap by any means. It is upwards of $20,000 just to get to America."

She was just interested in doing what she did, just without school and the other bullshit. Her mother was an esthetician, which is a fancy way of saying she gave pedicures to rich people, and her dad was a drunk and was always pretending to hold jobs longer than he did. She quickly realized that there are two kinds of people in the world, the people who sit in the chairs with their feet in the footbath, and the people who kneel in front of the footbath. She used to sit and study the women who came in. She'd pay attention to what they wore, what they'd talk about, and what she realized was that none of them actually did anything. They may have children to raise or homes to decorate.

You're going to go to your favorite app to listen to podcasts, and you're going to search American Fever Dream. We have a power nap episode. It's a mini episode. It's about 20 minutes. It goes through everything from the history of the attempts to ban TikTok to who would buy it and what problems that might even cause. The committee meeting to ban TikTok is at 2.30 PM today. So if you get a chance, go to the link in my bio and go ahead and give your congressman a call and tell them, please do not ban TikTok. And I know that calling can be intimidating, but this is actually quite easy because you're not going to talk to the congressman. What's going to happen is you're going to go to the link in my bio. You're going to put in your zip code. You're going to hit the button. It's going to tell you who your congressperson is. And then you're going to hit call now. A staffer is going to answer the phone and you're going to say, hi, this is my name. This is where I live. I'm a constituent of X congressperson, and I don't want them to ban TikTok. And then you can just hang right up. You don't have to do anything else. These are the congresspeople who are currently supporting a ban on TikTok. You can pause to read and you can watch the whole hearing for yourself at energycommerce.house.gov. I'll be right here with you the whole time."

The president has expressed full faith and confidence in me. So you're not surprised that he didn't call for your resignation? Is it typical that the president would go three days without talking to his secretary of defense? Is that typical? Is that a regular posture? Do you usually go days without talking to the commander in chief? I mean, that can happen. It depends on whether or not the president's on travel. If I'm on travel, there are times when we do go days without direct communication. So the big issue for me here is either the president is that aloof or you are irrelevant. Which one is it, Mr. Secretary? It's neither. That the president would go three days without knowing that his secretary of defense is not on the job. It's neither. The president is not aloof, and I am I participate in in all of the. Let me ask you this. On January 2nd, while you were in the hospital, President Biden was vacationing in the Caribbean. Your deputy, who the president didn't even know, had operational control, was on a beach in Puerto Rico. What kind of message does that send to our adversaries? Well, the key piece is that, number one, the deputy has the ability to she has access to secure communications. She has the ability to participate in decision making processes for wherever she is. Mr. Secretary, our adversaries should fear us. And what you've done is embarrassed us. Let me sum this up by this.

At every Beyonce concert, there's one part of one song where the crowd is expected to be silent. And I guess everyone follows this rule. People even bring signs to remind everyone. So Pink Hat's at this concert, there she is, and she's vibing. And when that quiet moment comes, and people around her are shocked. Even her friend right next to her is shocked. Because I guess people take that shit seriously. But see, Pink Hat, she doesn't give a damn. She's over here laughing her ass off, but she wouldn't be laughing for long.

So we got this bulk shipment of bath bombs, and then to get an idea, we tested out a hundred of them inside of this trash can, and it flowed out everywhere and was extremely foamy. So when we put all 5,000 bath bombs in a pool, the reaction should be a lot crazier. We then began unpacking all of them and putting them into these containers so that we could pour them directly into the pool. We had so many containers filled with bath bombs that it literally bordered the entire pool. So that's when we realized we're going to need at least 10 more people to help pour all these in. So tomorrow morning, a bunch of my friends are coming over, and we're going to be turning this pool into the world's biggest bath bomb."

No need for sophisticated tools, just use two handfuls of grass. Before performing the ritual, the alleged perpetrators are told to take an oath to the ancestors. The way this ritual works is that whoever tells the truth can be released from the grass, but if he tells a lie, the grass will entangle him. After that, the community will start interrogating him.

Now he had actually mentioned a specific piece of equipment, which is a Patriot surface-to-air munition system, a very high-tech, expensive, and effective munition system. Now the thing is this, he had also mentioned that Washington is not too pleased with what Ukraine is doing currently. If you are unaware, Ukraine is going beyond their own borders and going after Russian energy plants and other plants or targets beyond Ukraine's border into the western parts of Russian territory. Now according to the leader of Ukraine, he sees this as quote-unquote fair. He's in the middle of a conflict and he's going to go after Russian territory. However, the issue is this, Washington is not happy, and if Washington is not happy and are the ones providing the bulk of the money and equipment for the Ukrainian conflict, there's obviously some issues going on, and the leader of Ukraine again is saying we will have to retreat eastern Ukraine if we're not going to get more equipment.

Navalny has been described as Putin's fiercest political opponent and held large anti-Kremlin protests. The opposition leader survived assassination attempts. In 2020, he received global attention after being poisoned and then was transported to Germany for treatment where he was able to recover. Navalny accused the Kremlin of being responsible. The Kremlin denied involvement, despite a joint investigation by CNN and the Bellingcat group, which implicated the Russian security service in the incident. When Navalny returned to Russia in 2021, he was arrested and jailed. The United States Embassy writes that the charges and convictions are considered politically motivated. Since being in prison, his welfare has been a topic of concern. Spokespeople for Navalny were still seeking confirmation of his death early Friday morning"

A judge ordered Trump to pay more than 350 million dollars in penalties and barred him from serving as an officer or director of any New York company for three years. Today's decision comes months after he was found liable for falsifying business records in order to get better terms on loans and insurance. It is a major victory for New York State Attorney General Letitia James who first sued the former president back in 2022. Well tonight Trump called the ruling quote a total sham.

Now, what's interesting is that Central Command, who's in charge of the Middle Eastern Territories, they don't use the word attack. The verbiage being used is self-defense strike, or in a self-defense manner, going after the Houthis in Yemen. I'll let you decide on whether or not this is an offensive attack or a defensive attack. Nonetheless, the United States has managed to contain the Houthis so much that one single launch is almost not even capable out of the Houthis. Now, you'll also notice that the United States is not going after actual Houthi members, more specifically the logistics of the Houthis, like trucks, bunkers, munitions depots, things like that. And there's a massive reason for this. This is because the United States does not want to add to the humanitarian disaster that's already happening in Yemen, and the United States knows that they need to be careful, and it's way more safe just to go after material items and not actual people.

Now, listen, I'm not someone who likes dark beer, but in chocolate cupcakes, it works. And pair it with some salted caramel frosting using homemade salted caramel, it is perfection. And I saw this little trick I'd use from the boy who bakes where you whip caramel. I didn't even know you could do that.

So they are literally building their own community and building their own political power.

The Iranians are sort of in the catbird seat because they're just sitting on the sidelines. The militant groups that Iran sponsors that are located in both Syria and Iraq and are targeting the Americans are sort of doing the Iranians dirty work, right? From an Iranian point of view, this is a good situation because the last thing the Iranians want to do is get involved in a war with either Israel or the United States. We certainly don't want to get into a war with both of them. But the Iranians have managed to stay on the sidelines and they want to stay on the sidelines. We do not want to get into a fight with Iran. We don't want to fight with Hezbollah. We don't want to fight with the Houthis. We don't want to fight with these militias in Iran, and excuse me, in Iraq and Syria. We don't want the war to spread.

7329273345134939434,"Alright, so for context, this video is of Israeli NAMR APCs firing tracer rounds into some buildings that are occupied by enemy fighters in a city in the southern Gaza Strip. Apparently, the name of the city is Khan Yunis. But let's talk about the NAMR. That bad boy weighs 70 tons. It's also got a remotely operated machine gun that weighs less than 2 tons, which means that it's still got 68 tons. All of that weight comes from the APC's protection, layers and layers of ceramic, steel, nickel underneath bricks of explosive reactive armor, which reactive armor is basically like these bricks that when they're impacted by a projectile, they explode outward to essentially spoil that explosion. It's to prevent shape charges from penetrating the armor, essentially. So they actually wanted to develop the NAMR after the Israeli 1982 war with Lebanon. Reason being is because they got hit pretty hard by anti-tank missile teams in Lebanon and they lost a lot of people. So that's where the NAMR comes into place. It was to be a countermeasure to the anti-tank teams that were easily able to take out armored vehicles with personnel. Also, interestingly enough, the word NAMR is Hebrew for leopard, kind of like the Germans' tanks."

Texas National Guard soldiers have assembled miles and miles of razor wire here on the riverbanks of the Rio Grande and between the U.S. and Mexico to deter migrants from crossing into the country illegally. The Biden administration has said that this wire is impeding Border Patrol from processing people who have already arrived on U.S. soil, but the Texas agents are saying that this repels migrants and deters them from coming into the U.S. illegally. The Supreme Court earlier this week allowed the Biden administration to cut this wire, but right now, Texas is preventing Border Patrol from entering this public park here in Eagle Pass, Texas.

They said in some articles that it may seem profoundly silly to have a train on the moon, but there's some firm logic behind it. Because as the first astronauts were landing on the Sea of Tranquility in 1969, it was realized that a permanent human presence on Mars would require an infrastructure to maintain it. That includes mines for water, ice, nuclear power plants, factories, and yes, railways. Now if there's any aliens up there, they're about to find out why America doesn't have free health care."

Behind every migrant crossing, someone is making thousands of dollars. I have spoken with hundreds of migrants and each of them have paid between $5,000 to $10,000 to cross the U.S. border. For example, watch how much money the cartel makes in this 10-second clip. And here in the state of Arizona, businesses and organizations are making millions of dollars profiting off this mass migration here in the United States. The border here in Nogales, Arizona, it's a lot different than any other border I have seen. They have the huge wall and then they have the razor wire. This is a different type of razor wire, they even have spikes coming out to connect the razor wire. That way no one can cross over the wall. But if you go a few miles west, the border wall is completely open. I don't understand why right here it is so open because if you come all the way over here, then the border wall starts again, but there's just huge gaps for anyone to come in. I went back to the car to grab something and I looked back and people were literally coming through the border wall. People are coming over right now. There's a whole troop of them right here. I hurried and ran to tell border patrol, but border patrol seemed to not give a damn. People are coming! People are crossing right now! And he doesn't even care. With border patrol not stopping people from coming into the country, I had no other option. There's a coyote, there's a coyote, there's a coyote, he's got sunglasses on. But to welcome these people that way, the cartel member would not come after me. he got here with a baby in Zimbabwe. Yes. And how was the journey? It was good. Good? And now how does it feel to be here in the United States? Good. Good. It was very difficult to walk and to make the entire journey with the baby. Yes. Yes. The baby is good. The baby is good. And you guys are good? Yes we are good. Yes. Well, welcome."

So should we be freaking out? What is going on? Everyone calm down. The United States has known about this even all the way back in the 80s but now all of a sudden they have shed light to this program and the capability is now there. Now I should mention that Russia has denied all allegations and they never intend on doing this but I figured you should know what exactly this is. An anti-nuke or anti-satellite nuke is essentially you launch a nuke into outer space, you designate a satellite's path or orbit whether far or near earth orbit, we can get into that later, but essentially the radiation will disrupt the path of not only one satellite but many other satellites that are within that rotation or orbit around earth. So that's a very big issue because then all of a sudden when you're trying to go through your phone it might not work because this capability could destroy all communications on specific countries. So that's what's going on right now but I advise you to calm down because this capability will most likely not happen. Russia's saying they don't want to do it and even U.S. advisors are saying it's probably not going to happen anyway."

It's kind of similar to the Flying Dutchman burger, but it's a smash burger, so the exterior of the patty is extra crispy. And instead of the onions being the bun, the onions are smashed and infused into the patty. And for all those carb lovers, it's still served on a pillowy potato bun.

All of this started at the Texas border, Governor Greg Abbott of Texas was putting up razor wire at the border, and the Biden administration is opposed to this razor wire, so the Biden administration sent people to go and take this razor wire down. Now this decision to take down the razor wire has inflamed 25 other states, who not only feel that Biden is not doing enough to stop illegal immigration, but the governors of these states stand in solidarity with Texas in utilizing every tool and strategy to secure the border. As of right now, states like Virginia are sending soldiers and airmen to Texas to go and help secure the state's border. Other states are also being encouraged to send support to Texas. There are also many people currently calling for the secession of Texas from the US, and others are just straight up calling for a civil war over this whole border situation. And as of right now, it seems like the situation at the border is so tense, that just one wrong move from either side could end up being the spark that causes that civil war."

The people pissing on my door, they're tattooed up head to toe. And then there's no law against illegal migrants committing crimes. So again, it's lawlessness, non-payment of taxes, siphoning all our money to their native countries. And it's just killing our economy. Eric Adams just said he's going to give 4,000 migrants jobs. That means 4,000 civilians have less jobs. It's just not fair to Americans. It's getting scary. Right now, you know, people in the Bronx are getting attacked.

Girls are taught that if a man tries to abduct them by pushing them into a van or something like that, that they should fight with everything they have and that it's better to die on the street than get in that van for whatever happens next. You know what else girls are taught? That they should use their nails and their teeth so that afterwards there's DNA evidence. Afterwards. There's an assumption that this is going to happen at some point in a woman's life and that they need to know this information. You see, for men, the question of, is there anything worse than death? That's debatable. But it's not debatable for women. You ask any woman that question and they're going to say, yep, there are things worse than death. Now, this mindset that you have that so readily ignores the viewpoints of literally half of the people in the world, you can easily fix that through practicing empathy. So use your brain. Use the brain that God or the universe or Cthulhu or whoever gave you and tap into your imagination.

Thank God, that's what she kept saying, thank God. And I told her, I said, just take a deep breath and then here's what I need you to do. The driver was transported to University of Louisville Hospital with injuries that appear to be non-life-threatening, per police.

The whole world has been waiting to see what the reaction was going to be in the Middle East due to the whole air campaign retaliation attacks on countries like Iraq and Syria. Well, we have our first one. The country of Iraq has released a document stating they want to stop the sale of crude oil to the country of Jordan. The reason why this is very problematic is because Jordan is claiming they've had nothing to do with the retaliation attacks, but the country of Iraq is saying, Jordan, you provided the airspace and the cover for the US military to conduct their air campaigns over the Middle East. And this really rubbed Iraq the wrong way. So again, when you start to mess with the world trade and oil, prices start to go up, things start to get weird. I don't know exactly how things are going to react until Monday comes when the stock market reopens, but one thing is for sure, once you start messing with oil prices or stopping the sale of oil, you already know in the Middle East, things start to get violent.

7357203890904878379,"This is how I made $15,000 in 2 weeks and everyone at my local bank thinks that I'm a male stripper. So to make the $15,000, it's pretty simple. I just own this car wash. Super easy. I'm sure all of you guys know it's totally easy to own a car wash. And that's about it. And on the male stripper note, I walk into the bank like this with a ton of money. So this time I'm going to explain to you how I collect and process the money before I go to the bank. And this is how I do it. So I organize everything and put it through my cheap money counter from Amazon. And it works alright until I have to press reset like 2 times when the fives are going through because it kind of sucks sometimes. But it's better than counting by hand. So after that, I go through all the money. If I have coins that week, I will take them by weight. And the bank gives me these nice bags and I pour the coins into the bag. And that's how we get to deposit the coins. And after that, it's pretty simple. I put the money into these bags, pack it up tight, bring it into my bank. Everyone asks me what I do for a living to have this much cash and I say, I'm a male stripper."

And then, my favourite spice, garam masala. With three nice tablespoons of yoghurt. A little bit of oil. And now I'm going to start the sauce. Red onion. Start caramelising those onions. Couple of cardamom seeds. Cloves. Ginger. In. Chilli. In. Garlic. In. Butter. Into those onions as well. Tops for the sauce. Tops for the garnish. Into the pan. In there. Garam masala. Turmeric. Cumin. Cayenne. Toast that now. Another touch of butter in there. I'm going to start cooking the chicken. Beautiful. Now, that's caramelised all the way down. Time for tomato sauce. As that starts to boil, then we're going to add our double cream. And you can see, it's a really nice, rich colour. A touch of lemon juice. And now, put that in our blender. I like to pass this sauce through the sieve. Look how smooth that is. Now, look at the chicken. Absolutely delicious. Put my chicken in there now. Couple of knobs of butter. Hit that with some lemon zest. Fresh cilantro in at the end. That there is the most amazing butter chicken in literally 14 minutes and 58 seconds. Curry in a hurry."

The simple ingredients in this cream doesn't clog my pores, they're not too sticky, this leaves your skin more revitalized.

That's why they can do a liver transplant on just a little bit of liver and the liver will regrow. And I'm so glad that God made the liver a recoverable organ because some of the things that people are doing to their body, in ignorance, mostly granted, if we didn't have a recoverable organ, some of us wouldn't even live past our 20s. And these herbs help stimulate the liver to regrow and to recover. Cancer cannot get a hold on the body if the liver is working in optimum performance. And one liver herb that many people don't realize it is, is the lemon. So a great drink in the morning, remember you wake up, have your water, have another bit of water, and then when you come near the kitchen, have the kettle boiled and put the juice of a lemon in some water with a little bit of boiling water on top and have a warm lemon drink. Fantastic liver tonic early in the morning. Also, the lemon is an internal alkalizer so that will do a few things too."

I put my dry ingredients in a bowl and then I put in my locally sourced handmade butter milked from the Wagyu cows of Japan. I then whisked those ingredients together and added my wet ingredients and got in with my hands and made a nice dough ball and then cut it into two. After that I rolled it out and measured a perfect 5 by 3 inch rectangle in order to properly make a pop tart. After I cut my rectangle I put that aside and got ready to make my homemade organic locally picked locally sourced strawberry filling with strawberries hand picked from the Garden of Eden itself. I mashed them together and made my perfect strawberry filling and then placed that into the middle of one of the rectangles. I then closed the rectangle and used my hands to seal it and then used a fork to double seal it and made sure it looked just like a pop tart. I then put it to freeze for at least 7 to 10 hours. While it's freezing I made my icing with powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and half and half all locally sourced all organic. I take my pop tart out and put it in the oven for 25 minutes at 375 and once that's finished baking I carefully place the icing on top and there is my wonderful homemade pop tart. It was super quick and easy and only took about 10 to 12 hours to fully finish. These were gone in about .25 seconds. It's a new house favorite."

Now Catwoman was on vacation with her friends in Mykonos, and one night they all stay out late partying. And while they're walking back to their Airbnb, Catwoman hears a song playing in a nearby bar. And she loves this song. Oh my God, I literally ran in and started dancing. Also at that same bar is this guy, who we'll call Greek. And Greek is making his way through that bar, and that's when this moment happens. ‚ô™ I'm just gonna date myself. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I don't like anyone else. ‚ô™ But unfortunately it's late, Catwoman's friends are bugging her to leave, and she's intoxicated, so she does. And about a week goes by, and Catwoman is back in Malaysia from her vacation. And she's forgotten all about that drunken night and this moment, until she starts looking at some of the vacation footage. And that's where she really notices Greek, like, damn, he kind of fine. I was like, sis, were you blind? He could be the one. I could be with a Greek man right now. So she takes the video of this moment and posts it to TikTok, and captions it asking the internet to help find him. And that video blows up like 16 million views. But unfortunately, nobody knows who he is."

The state's complex fault system, particularly the San Andreas Fault, continues to be a major concern for seismic activity. According to the USGS, there is a 72% chance of a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake striking the San Francisco Bay Area before March. Number 2. Tennessee. This state is part of the New Madrid Seismic Zone, a region of high seismic activity in the central US. This zone is caused by an ancient rift in the crust that has been reactivated by plate motions and glacial rebound. The USGS predicts that there is a 7-10% chance of a magnitude 6 or greater earthquake occurring in this zone in the next 50 days. Before revealing the number 1, remember to subscribe and like the video. Number 1. Alaska. This state is situated on a major plate boundary, where the Pacific Plate is subducting under the North American Plate. This process generates a lot of friction and heat, which can cause volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. The USGS estimates a 12% chance of an earthquake in Alaska soon. And you? Are you in one of these states and are you taking caution now? Let me know in the comments."

Patients would use the chip to communicate with computers and smartphones. What this could potentially mean for patients with paralysis after strokes, accidents, and diseases including ALS. Here's ABC's Will Reeve tonight. Tonight a sign of hope for millions of Americans living with paralysis. Billionaire Elon Musk announcing that his company Neuralink has surgically implanted its first brain chip in a human. He says the patient is recovering well and called the initial results promising. The device is designed to interpret your neural activity so you can operate a computer or smartphone by simply thinking. The goal is to help patients with debilitating conditions control external devices with their thoughts. Experts say the technology could one day benefit people paralyzed by stroke, brain and spinal cord injury, or ALS. This would be a major game changer if it were to be proven to be safe and effective. Neuralink's device is now in clinical trials joining a handful of other groups testing brain computer interface technology. This woman who had lost her voice was able to have a conversation with her husband through a mind-controlled avatar. I was thinking about running to the store. What time will you be home? And Swiss researchers used artificial intelligence and brain and spine implants to help this man paralyzed in a motorcycle accident to walk again. Experts say it's still a long road to prove the success and safety of Neuralink's device and others like it before it would be approved for consumers. But David, this is a beacon of hope for people living with paralysis from things like stroke or ALS or brain or spinal cord injury. Those were remarkable examples you shared with us Will. Thank you. The wife able to communicate with her husband really something. Will Reef tonight. Thank you Will.

It was founded more than 4,000 years ago and is located in modern-day Iraq on the lower Euphrates River in southern Mesopotamia. And it's known for building one of the seven wonders of the world, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. It had layers of gardens going up of a huge variety of trees, shrubs, and vines and was on a green mountain of mud bricks. This thing was huge. It was also the place where they believed the Old Testament story of the Tower of Babel happened. Where, you know, they were trying to build the huge tower to reach heaven and then God made them all speak different languages and they couldn't finish it. In modern-day, after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the U.S. built a military base on the ruins of Babylon, which was said to cause major damage to the archaeological site.
