Mr. Garcia, I don't know about in Guatemala, but in Estados Unidos, 13 is still rape. Many of Biden's newcomers are unfamiliar with, how shall I say it, our cultural standards.

7343390993674177838,"Mark my words, tomorrow night will be Joe Biden's last State of the Union address, and that's because the American people are not going to invite him back to give another one next year. And that's because on issue after issue that the American people care about, Joe Biden has failed the American people. People are worn out, and they're worried for themselves and their families. They understand that their lives have been made worse by Joe Biden and the Democrats. People are begging for solutions. What we're likely to hear is the president bragging about Bidenomics and blaming others for the crisis that he has created at the border. "

Super easy. I'm sure all of you guys know it's totally easy to own a car wash. And that's about it. And on the male stripper note, I walk into the bank like this with a ton of money. So this time I'm going to explain to you how I collect and process the money before I go to the bank. And this is how I do it. So I organize everything and put it through my cheap money counter from Amazon. And it works alright until I have to press reset like 2 times when the fives are going through because it kind of sucks sometimes. But it's better than counting by hand. So after that, I go through all the money. If I have coins that week, I will take them by weight. And the bank gives me these nice bags and I pour the coins into the bag. And that's how we get to deposit the coins. And after that, it's pretty simple. I put the money into these bags, pack it up tight, bring it into my bank. Everyone asks me what I do for a living to have this much cash and I say, I'm a male stripper."

As that starts to boil, then we're going to add our double cream. And you can see, it's a really nice, rich colour. A touch of lemon juice. And now, put that in our blender. I like to pass this sauce through the sieve. Look how smooth that is. Now, look at the chicken. Absolutely delicious. Put my chicken in there now. Couple of knobs of butter. Hit that with some lemon zest. Fresh cilantro in at the end. That, there, is the most amazing butter chicken in literally 14 minutes and 58 seconds. Curry in a hurry."

Dunkin' Donuts came to Oakland. Dunkin' Donuts shut down. Can't make it no more. We have the Starbucks right here. Starbucks gone. Closed down. Leaving Oakland. Can't make it here no more. We just got this Raising Cane's restaurant over here. They had to close down the inside. Gone. Can't open no more. Almost every business that opens up in Oakland closes. Businesses close. Everything close. Lunch and Chipotle close. In-N-Out Burger on the other side. This used to be a Wal-Mart. We don't even have a Wal-Mart in Oakland. You know you ain't got no jobs if you don't got no Wal-Mart in your city. You know your city's struggling if you don't got no Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart closed down. Wal-Mart could not survive Oakland. Oakland is a hard place to survive. We got In-N-Out Burger right there on the other side ready to close down and I'm pretty sure Panda went after that. Next to T-Mobile, Chipotle, the little restaurant in there closed. The little restaurants across the street you can't see in their parking lot closed. All these big old buildings, big giant buildings, empty. "

7328462763796499758,"Dandelion is the liver herb. Your liver is a recoverable organ. It's the only organ in the body that has the ability to regrow or recover. That's why they can do a liver transplant on just a little bit of liver and the liver will regrow. And I'm so glad that God made the liver a recoverable organ because some of the things that people are doing to their body, in ignorance, mostly granted, if we didn't have a recoverable organ, some of us wouldn't even live past our 20s. And these herbs help stimulate the liver to regrow and to recover. Cancer cannot get a hold on the body if the liver is working in optimum performance. And one liver herb that many people don't realize it is, is the lemon. So a great drink in the morning, remember you wake up, have your water, have another bit of water, and then when you come near the kitchen, have the kettle boiled and put the juice of a lemon in some water with a little bit of boiling water on top and have a warm lemon drink. Fantastic liver tonic early in the morning. Also, the lemon is an internal alkalizer so that will do a few things too."

The state's complex fault system, particularly the San Andreas Fault, continues to be a major concern for seismic activity. According to the USGS, there is a 72% chance of a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake striking the San Francisco Bay Area before March. Number 2. Tennessee. This state is part of the New Madrid Seismic Zone, a region of high seismic activity in the central US. This zone is caused by an ancient rift in the crust that has been reactivated by plate motions and glacial rebound. The USGS predicts that there is a 7-10% chance of a magnitude 6 or greater earthquake occurring in this zone in the next 50 days. Before revealing the number 1, remember to subscribe and like the video. Number 1. Alaska. This state is situated on a major plate boundary, where the Pacific Plate is subducting under the North American Plate. This process generates a lot of friction and heat, which can cause volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. The USGS estimates a 12% chance of an earthquake in Alaska soon. And you?

So Israel has gone to extraordinary lengths, calling up people, civilians, Palestinians in Gaza, telling them, leave your home, sending pamphlets. We have done that effort. Hamas tries to keep them at gunpoint. We'll clear them out of harm's way. We'll complete the job and achieve total victory, which is necessary to give a secure future for Israel, a better future for Gaza, a better future for the Middle East, and a setback for the Iran terror axis. That's in all our interest. It's in America's interest, too."

It was founded more than 4,000 years ago and is located in modern-day Iraq on the lower Euphrates River in southern Mesopotamia. And it's known for building one of the seven wonders of the world, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. It had layers of gardens going up of a huge variety of trees, shrubs, and vines and was on a green mountain of mud bricks. This thing was huge. It was also the place where they believed the Old Testament story of the Tower of Babel happened. Where, you know, they were trying to build the huge tower to reach heaven and then God made them all speak different languages and they couldn't finish it. In modern-day, after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the U.S. built a military base on the ruins of Babylon, which was said to cause major damage to the archaeological site. So enter your own conspiracy there. It's kind of weird. Follow for more."

They're perfectly crisp on the outside, gooey on the inside and also so easy to make because we're using melted butter. I was heavy into overnight cookie dough where you chill cookie dough overnight to get the most flavor and texture. And when I was making these, I wanted to challenge myself to get that flavor and texture without the weight. And oh my gosh, my dog, she's so freaking adorable. But anyway, somehow we nailed it by using the most basic ingredients, flour, butter, sugar, vanilla, and the best chocolate chips. I ran a little experiment last year to find the best chocolate chips for chocolate chip cookies and these Trader Joe's semi-sweet won out by a landslide. Now there's a few tricks that elevate these chocolate chip cookies and first is our scooper. Using a large ice cream scoop creates a variety of textures in your cookies and then top with chocolate chips before baking. Pull them out of the oven when the center still looks a little underdone. Trust me, once they cool, that center will set into this ooey gooey texture, top with sea salt and they are perfect."

7348968140249795870,"Homemade salted caramel sauce is so much easier to make than you think, and I use it in so many of my recipes. First, it is very important that your butter is at room temperature. And as for the pan, it is best to use a medium, heavy bottom sauce pan so your caramel doesn't burn. First, we're gonna heat the sugar over medium heat, and this will take a little bit longer if you're using an electric stovetop. And while we wait for that to heat up, I'm gonna warm our cream as well. After a few minutes, the sugar will slowly start to melt, and we'll kinda wanna nudge it around just for even browning. Very quickly, that sugar will darken, so immediately take it off the heat and mix in the butter. This is why it's important the butter's at room temperature and the cream is warm, otherwise, if you add cold ingredients to hot sugar, it'll just all try to harden up. And once it's chilled, it'll thicken into the perfect consistency. "

We've used Rogaine enough as an example where women's Rogaine at 5% is way overpriced compared to men's Rogaine at 5%. They may look similar in pricing but you're only getting a third of the quantity as a woman versus as a man. CVS is another example. Here they appear to be doing better right because they write that you're gonna get a six-month supply for $55.99 as a woman. As a man getting a six-month supply you're paying $80.99 but the difference here they're getting double the amount. They're getting six cans versus women only getting three cans. So stop paying the pink tax. As a woman you can use 5% minoxidil on your hair even though it's marketed for the men and you will save money in the process. Is that the alarm?

It has been an incredibly tough couple of months for our entire family but I've had a fantastic medical team who've taken great care of me for which I'm so grateful. In January I underwent major abdominal surgery in London and at the time it was thought that my condition was non-cancerous. The surgery was successful however tests after the operation found cancer had been present. My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy and I'm now in the early stages of that treatment. This of course came as a huge shock and William and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family. As you can imagine this has taken time. It has taken me time to recover from major surgery in order to start my treatment but most importantly it has taken us time to explain everything to George, Charlotte and Louis in a way that's appropriate for them and to reassure them that I'm going to be okay.

And what makes this coffee cake so special is not only the extra crumble, but the butter. When you use incredibly rich and high quality butter, the flavor, the flavor of this cake is crazy.

7348162190538542379,"My husband woke up craving chocolate brownies the other day, so I started by cutting open some cacao pods and taking out the beans. Then I wrapped them up to ferment for 8 days, during which I mixed them each day and put them in a cooler with warm water each night to help keep the fermentation going. After 8 days, they were perfectly fermented, so I laid them out in the sun until they were all dry, which took about 12 days. Next, I roasted them in the oven and then removed the shells. This part is so satisfying. And then I poured the beans into my wet grinder along with some raw sugar and let them grind for about 48 hours. At one point, I held a blow dryer on there to help release the cocoa butter from the beans. And eventually, we had beautiful liquid chocolate. It was still very thick for a variety of reasons, which made it pretty hard to temper. So some of the bars were bloomed, which looks like this. But it didn't matter because I was melting them for brownies. So the next day, I chopped up some of my fresh chocolate and melted it with brown butter in the microwave until it was all nice and melty. Then I cracked 3 eggs into a bowl, added some sugar, and whisked until it was nice and fluffy. From there, I added in flour and a little bit of cocoa powder. And then I folded in my melted chocolate and butter. Lastly, I added some chopped fresh chocolate and then I poured this into a pan and baked for about 25 minutes. And my husband was so excited. He said he's been craving these for 3 weeks, which is how long it took to make them. So we ate them hot out of the oven, topped with vanilla ice cream, olive oil, and flaky salt. They had the perfect texture and the perfect chocolate flavor. And I'm 100% serious, they were the best brownies we've ever had."

It's not necessarily because they have better eyelid skin than you, they just have access to some really good Korean beauty treatments. I've seen a few reviews of this, and people are claiming it instantly freshen up their eyes. I don't know how that's possible, but let's try it. Did you know the skin around your eyes can be less than 1mm thick, making it the thinnest skin on your entire body? For this reason, you have to be super careful what you use on your eyes. Alright, in all seriousness, I definitely feel a difference with this on, and the texture and formulation of this eye serum gives you an immediate cosmetic payoff. Take a look at this before and after, showing how it immediately brightens the eye area. With long-term use, you'll also notice improvement in dark circles, fine lines, and puffiness. Go look up vegan collagen eye serum right now. And comment below what you think about Korean skincare."

There has recently been an increase of migrants from China coming to the US. The journey of a Chinese migrant is a lot different from a migrant from South America. The main reason being is that it is against the law for a Chinese citizen to leave China, unless it is for what Chinese law calls private business. Private business means residing, visiting relatives, visiting friends, inheriting properties, going abroad to study at own expense, obtaining employment, making a tour or other private affairs. Simply leaving your country doesn't qualify as private business. And the Chinese president even banned the exit of tens of thousands of people at one time. And the journey is not cheap by any means. It is upwards of $20,000 just to get to America."

You're going to go to your favorite app to listen to podcasts, and you're going to search American Fever Dream. We have a power nap episode. It's a mini episode. It's about 20 minutes. It goes through everything from the history of the attempts to ban TikTok to who would buy it and what problems that might even cause. The committee meeting to ban TikTok is at 2.30 PM today. So if you get a chance, go to the link in my bio and go ahead and give your congressman a call and tell them, please do not ban TikTok. And I know that calling can be intimidating, but this is actually quite easy because you're not going to talk to the congressman. What's going to happen is you're going to go to the link in my bio. You're going to put in your zip code. You're going to hit the button. It's going to tell you who your congressperson is. And then you're going to hit call now. A staffer is going to answer the phone and you're going to say, hi, this is my name. This is where I live. I'm a constituent of X congressperson, and I don't want them to ban TikTok. And then you can just hang right up. You don't have to do anything else. These are the congresspeople who are currently supporting a ban on TikTok. You can pause to read and you can watch the whole hearing for yourself at energycommerce.house.gov. I'll be right here with you the whole time."

The president has expressed full faith and confidence in me. So you're not surprised that he didn't call for your resignation? Is it typical that the president would go three days without talking to his secretary of defense? Is that typical? Is that a regular posture? Do you usually go days without talking to the commander in chief? I mean, that can happen. It depends on whether or not the president's on travel. If I'm on travel, there are times when we do go days without direct communication. So the big issue for me here is either the president is that aloof or you are irrelevant. Which one is it, Mr. Secretary? It's neither. That the president would go three days without knowing that his secretary of defense is not on the job. It's neither. The president is not aloof, and I am I participate in in all of the. Let me ask you this. On January 2nd, while you were in the hospital, President Biden was vacationing in the Caribbean. Your deputy, who the president didn't even know, had operational control, was on a beach in Puerto Rico. What kind of message does that send to our adversaries? Well, the key piece is that, number one, the deputy has the ability to she has access to secure communications. She has the ability to participate in decision making processes for wherever she is. Mr. Secretary, our adversaries should fear us. And what you've done is embarrassed us. Let me sum this up by this.

A leading Russian propaganda outlet said that your disappearance, quote, effectively compromised the gentleman's time. Expired. You're not recognized as a ranking member."

So when we put all 5,000 bath bombs in a pool, the reaction should be a lot crazier. We then began unpacking all of them and putting them into these containers so that we could pour them directly into the pool. We had so many containers filled with bath bombs that it literally bordered the entire pool. So that's when we realized we're going to need at least 10 more people to help pour all these in.

Even if you do read history books in America, you kind of forget that Russia defeated Hitler and that we had a little bit to do with it, but not that much. We defeated Japan and Britain held firm and, you know, they wouldn't give up and they will But Russia really defeated Hitler. And you kind of forget that now. And especially because we're living at a time of intense anti-Russian propaganda because we're fighting a proxy war for some reason with Russia over Ukraine. "

Now he had actually mentioned a specific piece of equipment, which is a Patriot surface-to-air munition system, a very high-tech, expensive, and effective munition system. Now the thing is this, he had also mentioned that Washington is not too pleased with what Ukraine is doing currently. If you are unaware, Ukraine is going beyond their own borders and going after Russian energy plants and other plants or targets beyond Ukraine's border into the western parts of Russian territory. Now according to the leader of Ukraine, he sees this as quote-unquote fair. He's in the middle of a conflict and he's going to go after Russian territory. However, the issue is this, Washington is not happy, and if Washington is not happy and are the ones providing the bulk of the money and equipment for the Ukrainian conflict, there's obviously some issues going on, and the leader of Ukraine again is saying we will have to retreat eastern Ukraine if we're not going to get more equipment.

Navalny has been described as Putin's fiercest political opponent and held large anti-Kremlin protests. The opposition leader survived assassination attempts. In 2020, he received global attention after being poisoned and then was transported to Germany for treatment where he was able to recover. Navalny accused the Kremlin of being responsible. The Kremlin denied involvement, despite a joint investigation by CNN and the Bellingcat group, which implicated the Russian security service in the incident. When Navalny returned to Russia in 2021, he was arrested and jailed. The United States Embassy writes that the charges and convictions are considered politically motivated. Since being in prison, his welfare has been a topic of concern. Spokespeople for Navalny were still seeking confirmation of his death early Friday morning"

Now, what's interesting is that Central Command, who's in charge of the Middle Eastern Territories, they don't use the word attack. The verbiage being used is self-defense strike, or in a self-defense manner, going after the Houthis in Yemen. I'll let you decide on whether or not this is an offensive attack or a defensive attack. Nonetheless, the United States has managed to contain the Houthis so much that one single launch is almost not even capable out of the Houthis. Now, you'll also notice that the United States is not going after actual Houthi members, more specifically the logistics of the Houthis, like trucks, bunkers, munitions depots, things like that. And there's a massive reason for this. This is because the United States does not want to add to the humanitarian disaster that's already happening in Yemen, and the United States knows that they need to be careful, and it's way more safe just to go after material items and not actual people.

So they are literally building their own community and building their own political power.

7329273345134939434,"Alright, so for context, this video is of Israeli NAMR APCs firing tracer rounds into some buildings that are occupied by enemy fighters in a city in the southern Gaza Strip. Apparently, the name of the city is Khan Yunis. But let's talk about the NAMR. That bad boy weighs 70 tons. It's also got a remotely operated machine gun that weighs less than 2 tons, which means that it's still got 68 tons. All of that weight comes from the APC's protection, layers and layers of ceramic, steel, nickel underneath bricks of explosive reactive armor, which reactive armor is basically like these bricks that when they're impacted by a projectile, they explode outward to essentially spoil that explosion. It's to prevent shape charges from penetrating the armor, essentially. So they actually wanted to develop the NAMR after the Israeli 1982 war with Lebanon. Reason being is because they got hit pretty hard by anti-tank missile teams in Lebanon and they lost a lot of people. So that's where the NAMR comes into place. It was to be a countermeasure to the anti-tank teams that were easily able to take out armored vehicles with personnel. Also, interestingly enough, the word NAMR is Hebrew for leopard, kind of like the Germans' tanks."

They said in some articles that it may seem profoundly silly to have a train on the moon, but there's some firm logic behind it. Because as the first astronauts were landing on the Sea of Tranquility in 1969, it was realized that a permanent human presence on Mars would require an infrastructure to maintain it. That includes mines for water, ice, nuclear power plants, factories, and yes, railways. Now if there's any aliens up there, they're about to find out why America doesn't have free health care."

And keep in mind, administration officials have made it clear that this is not a one-off, that this will extend beyond today. For days, it will be a campaign, and it will involve multiple strikes and other operations.

Behind every migrant crossing, someone is making thousands of dollars. I have spoken with hundreds of migrants and each of them have paid between $5,000 to $10,000 to cross the U.S. border. For example, watch how much money the cartel makes in this 10-second clip. And here in the state of Arizona, businesses and organizations are making millions of dollars profiting off this mass migration here in the United States. The border here in Nogales, Arizona, it's a lot different than any other border I have seen. They have the huge wall and then they have the razor wire. This is a different type of razor wire, they even have spikes coming out to connect the razor wire. That way no one can cross over the wall. But if you go a few miles west, the border wall is completely open. I don't understand why right here it is so open because if you come all the way over here, then the border wall starts again, but there's just huge gaps for anyone to come in. I went back to the car to grab something and I looked back and people were literally coming through the border wall. People are coming over right now. There's a whole troop of them right here. I hurried and ran to tell border patrol, but border patrol seemed to not give a damn. People are coming! People are crossing right now! And he doesn't even care. With border patrol not stopping people from coming into the country, I had no other option. There's a coyote, there's a coyote, there's a coyote, he's got sunglasses on. But to welcome these people that way, the cartel member would not come after me. he got here with a baby in Zimbabwe. Yes. And how was the journey? It was good. Good?

So should we be freaking out? What is going on? Everyone calm down. The United States has known about this even all the way back in the 80s but now all of a sudden they have shed light to this program and the capability is now there. Now I should mention that Russia has denied all allegations and they never intend on doing this but I figured you should know what exactly this is. An anti-nuke or anti-satellite nuke is essentially you launch a nuke into outer space, you designate a satellite's path or orbit whether far or near earth orbit, we can get into that later, but essentially the radiation will disrupt the path of not only one satellite but many other satellites that are within that rotation or orbit around earth. So that's a very big issue because then all of a sudden when you're trying to go through your phone it might not work because this capability could destroy all communications on specific countries. So that's what's going on right now but I advise you to calm down because this capability will most likely not happen. Russia's saying they don't want to do it and even U.S. advisors are saying it's probably not going to happen anyway."

To be honest, I had no idea this burger existed until I went to Big Trouble Pizza. It's kind of similar to the Flying Dutchman burger, but it's a smash burger, so the exterior of the patty is extra crispy. And instead of the onions being the bun, the onions are smashed and infused into the patty. And for all those carb lovers, it's still served on a pillowy potato bun. But what I love most about this burger is that amazing caramelization of the onions in the smash patty. "

All of this started at the Texas border, Governor Greg Abbott of Texas was putting up razor wire at the border, and the Biden administration is opposed to this razor wire, so the Biden administration sent people to go and take this razor wire down. Now this decision to take down the razor wire has inflamed 25 other states, who not only feel that Biden is not doing enough to stop illegal immigration, but the governors of these states stand in solidarity with Texas in utilizing every tool and strategy to secure the border. As of right now, states like Virginia are sending soldiers and airmen to Texas to go and help secure the state's border. Other states are also being encouraged to send support to Texas. There are also many people currently calling for the secession of Texas from the US, and others are just straight up calling for a civil war over this whole border situation. And as of right now, it seems like the situation at the border is so tense, that just one wrong move from either side could end up being the spark that causes that civil war."

The people pissing on my door, they're tattooed up head to toe. And then there's no law against illegal migrants committing crimes.

That means 4,000 civilians have less jobs. It's just not fair to Americans. It's getting scary. Right now, you know, people in the Bronx are getting attacked.

Girls are taught that if a man tries to abduct them by pushing them into a van or something like that, that they should fight with everything they have and that it's better to die on the street than get in that van for whatever happens next. You know what else girls are taught? That they should use their nails and their teeth so that afterwards there's DNA evidence. Afterwards. There's an assumption that this is going to happen at some point in a woman's life and that they need to know this information. You see, for men, the question of, is there anything worse than death? That's debatable. But it's not debatable for women. You ask any woman that question and they're going to say, yep, there are things worse than death. Now, this mindset that you have that so readily ignores the viewpoints of literally half of the people in the world, you can easily fix that through practicing empathy. So use your brain.

Well, we have our first one. The country of Iraq has released a document stating they want to stop the sale of crude oil to the country of Jordan. The reason why this is very problematic is because Jordan is claiming they've had nothing to do with the retaliation attacks, but the country of Iraq is saying, Jordan, you provided the airspace and the cover for the US military to conduct their air campaigns over the Middle East. And this really rubbed Iraq the wrong way. So again, when you start to mess with the world trade and oil, prices start to go up, things start to get weird. I don't know exactly how things are going to react until Monday comes when the stock market reopens, but one thing is for sure, once you start messing with oil prices or stopping the sale of oil, you already know in the Middle East, things start to get violent.

Super easy. I'm sure all of you guys know it's totally easy to own a car wash. And that's about it. And on the male stripper note, I walk into the bank like this with a ton of money. So this time I'm going to explain to you how I collect and process the money before I go to the bank. And this is how I do it. So I organize everything and put it through my cheap money counter from Amazon. And it works alright until I have to press reset like 2 times when the fives are going through because it kind of sucks sometimes. But it's better than counting by hand. So after that, I go through all the money. If I have coins that week, I will take them by weight. And the bank gives me these nice bags and I pour the coins into the bag. And that's how we get to deposit the coins. And after that, it's pretty simple. I put the money into these bags, pack it up tight, bring it into my bank. Everyone asks me what I do for a living to have this much cash and I say, I'm a male stripper."

7328462763796499758,"Dandelion is the liver herb. Your liver is a recoverable organ. It's the only organ in the body that has the ability to regrow or recover. That's why they can do a liver transplant on just a little bit of liver and the liver will regrow. And I'm so glad that God made the liver a recoverable organ because some of the things that people are doing to their body, in ignorance, mostly granted, if we didn't have a recoverable organ, some of us wouldn't even live past our 20s. And these herbs help stimulate the liver to regrow and to recover. Cancer cannot get a hold on the body if the liver is working in optimum performance. And one liver herb that many people don't realize it is, is the lemon. So a great drink in the morning, remember you wake up, have your water, have another bit of water, and then when you come near the kitchen, have the kettle boiled and put the juice of a lemon in some water with a little bit of boiling water on top and have a warm lemon drink. Fantastic liver tonic early in the morning. Also, the lemon is an internal alkalizer so that will do a few things too."

I put my dry ingredients in a bowl and then I put in my locally sourced handmade butter milked from the Wagyu cows of Japan. I then whisked those ingredients together and added my wet ingredients and got in with my hands and made a nice dough ball and then cut it into two. After that I rolled it out and measured a perfect 5 by 3 inch rectangle in order to properly make a pop tart. After I cut my rectangle I put that aside and got ready to make my homemade organic locally picked locally sourced strawberry filling with strawberries hand picked from the Garden of Eden itself. I mashed them together and made my perfect strawberry filling and then placed that into the middle of one of the rectangles. I then closed the rectangle and used my hands to seal it and then used a fork to double seal it and made sure it looked just like a pop tart. I then put it to freeze for at least 7 to 10 hours. While it's freezing I made my icing with powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and half and half all locally sourced all organic. I take my pop tart out and put it in the oven for 25 minutes at 375 and once that's finished baking I carefully place the icing on top and there is my wonderful homemade pop tart. It was super quick and easy and only took about 10 to 12 hours to fully finish. These were gone in about .25 seconds. It's a new house favorite."

I feel like this shade family is too light. This one might work. That's too dark. Okay, so it's this one. Look for the swatch that just immediately blends in. For me, it's obviously the cool tone.

According to the USGS, there is a 72% chance of a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake striking the San Francisco Bay Area before March. Number 2. Tennessee. This state is part of the New Madrid Seismic Zone, a region of high seismic activity in the central US. This zone is caused by an ancient rift in the crust that has been reactivated by plate motions and glacial rebound. The USGS predicts that there is a 7-10% chance of a magnitude 6 or greater earthquake occurring in this zone in the next 50 days. Before revealing the number 1, remember to subscribe and like the video. Number 1. Alaska. This state is situated on a major plate boundary, where the Pacific Plate is subducting under the North American Plate.

Patients would use the chip to communicate with computers and smartphones. What this could potentially mean for patients with paralysis after strokes, accidents, and diseases including ALS. Here's ABC's Will Reeve tonight. Tonight a sign of hope for millions of Americans living with paralysis. Billionaire Elon Musk announcing that his company Neuralink has surgically implanted its first brain chip in a human. He says the patient is recovering well and called the initial results promising. The device is designed to interpret your neural activity so you can operate a computer or smartphone by simply thinking. The goal is to help patients with debilitating conditions control external devices with their thoughts. Experts say the technology could one day benefit people paralyzed by stroke, brain and spinal cord injury, or ALS. This would be a major game changer if it were to be proven to be safe and effective. Neuralink's device is now in clinical trials joining a handful of other groups testing brain computer interface technology. This woman who had lost her voice was able to have a conversation with her husband through a mind-controlled avatar. I was thinking about running to the store. What time will you be home? And Swiss researchers used artificial intelligence and brain and spine implants to help this man paralyzed in a motorcycle accident to walk again. Experts say it's still a long road to prove the success and safety of Neuralink's device and others like it before it would be approved for consumers. But David, this is a beacon of hope for people living with paralysis from things like stroke or ALS or brain or spinal cord injury. Those were remarkable examples you shared with us Will. Thank you.

It was founded more than 4,000 years ago and is located in modern-day Iraq on the lower Euphrates River in southern Mesopotamia. And it's known for building one of the seven wonders of the world, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. It had layers of gardens going up of a huge variety of trees, shrubs, and vines and was on a green mountain of mud bricks. This thing was huge. It was also the place where they believed the Old Testament story of the Tower of Babel happened. Where, you know, they were trying to build the huge tower to reach heaven and then God made them all speak different languages and they couldn't finish it. In modern-day, after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the U.S. built a military base on the ruins of Babylon, which was said to cause major damage to the archaeological site.

There is mist all around, driving on it is like flying through the air. This scene shocked the world. It is the most expensive suspension bridge in China, Hunan-Aizhai Bridge. It is known as the Sky Bridge in the sky. The bridge is 4,600 feet long. The vertical height from the bridge deck to the valley floor is 1,200 feet. It is equivalent to the height of a 100-story building. Under the bridge is the Dehong Grand Canyon, which is difficult even for birds to cross. There are cliffs all around. Construction is extremely difficult. What's even more shocking is that the bridge is a double-layer channel design. The upper level can allow 200 vehicles to pass at the same time. The lower level can accommodate thousands of people walking and sightseeing. After the completion of the bridge, it completely opened up the traffic bottleneck between the two places. The bridge was built by more than 1,000 builders and took four years, set four world records. It is a miracle project in the history of world bridges.

The President of Russia said there are enough specialists in the field of Russian-American relations and in the field of strategic restraint. He said he doesn't think we're rushing towards nuclear conflict. The President of Russia also claimed that Donald Trump scolded him for sympathizing with Joe Biden back in 2019. He even quoted Trump as calling Joe Biden Sleepy Joe in the conversation with him. He also said his government would not interfere in US elections. But he did lie about that in 2016, so there's no reason to believe he wouldn't again.

Now there are a lot of legal baseball cases here in the United States and that means that there's been a lot of precedent on what courts will do moving forward. Courts have ruled that if you are a baseball player, a spectator, an umpire, or anyone participating in the sport of baseball in any way, and you park your vehicle in a baseball parking lot, you assume the risk. This is because as a spectator or a player or even an official, you know how baseball works and you're expecting that flying balls will be happening all around your vehicle. But courts have also ruled, ladies and gentlemen, that when it comes to a vehicle that is driving on a public road, that they do not assume the risk of a flying baseball. And when you'll watch this video, you can see that this baseball player knew that they could potentially hit the vehicle and still decided to swing the bat anyway. That driver did not assume the risk, which means that that driver is not going to be held liable. It makes this baseball player liable or the baseball league if they belong to one for all the damages that happen next. "

She also goes on to say that it's a long-lasting Relationship built on mutual trust and commitment to doing what is right?

7346342355999460639,"Okay, so as a former FBI agent, I actually wanna talk about the controversy surrounding the TikTok social media platform of a little girl named Ren Eleanor. She's about four or five years old and her mom's name is Jacqueline. And there's been a lot of controversy on TikTok surrounding the fact that she's basically being exploited on this platform. I've looked through it. I have to say, I absolutely believe that she is being exploited. So y'all know, I don't post pictures of my daughter on my sort of open social media pages. I have one of her, but it's of her back. I just feel strongly about the fact she really can't like consent to that. And this page is really about me and not necessarily about her. That being said though, I don't have issues with parents and kids who do these kinds of things together and who sort of know what they're doing. But I looked at this page and this page is all about just a four-year-old. That's it. It's not about her mom and her mom's lifestyle or anything like that. It is all about a four-year-old. And I have a significant problem with that because she really can't consent to that. And the mom is profiting off of this. And I have to wonder, is the mom pocketing all this money or is she giving it to her daughter, which is really who it should go to because the reality is that she's doing the work for the page. Mom's just posting. But there's also issues too with some perhaps child predators following the page, commenting on the page. And that is also concerning. You have to remember when you post pictures of yourself, your children, whomever, anyone has access to that. And that's what's happening here. That includes child predators. Also, there's some videos of her that people have commented sort of, why are they not flagged? Because it could violate community guidelines. And the ones they're talking about are the ones regarding sexual exploitation of minors. I just wanna read you the definition of how TikTok views that. It's abuse of a position of power or trust for sexual purposes, including profiting financially, socially, sexually, or politically from the exploitation of a minor. So here's the thing. I do believe a minor is being exploited here, but I have noticed that she took down the 4th of July picture that was in question, but is not addressing it. So she knows her behavior, in my opinion, is wrong. The mom knows this. I do have to wonder who the majority of her followers are. If they are child predators, which I don't know if they are or not. I don't think that they are. Then the reality is she is sexually exploiting her child. But I'm guessing that that's why this hasn't been flagged for community guidelines unethical. Yes, is she probably taking money that, in my opinion, probably belongs to her child? Absolutely. And I do think this account is highly problematic. "

What did you think when Joe Biden suggested that COVID could be cured by shining a bright light inside the body? It is very sad that Joe Biden is clearly a dementia patient. Supposedly we hit the body with a tremendous, whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light. What do you think about Joe Biden saying that getting through the 80s without getting HIV was his own personal Vietnam? Again, it's very sad, his mental capacity, and that that is a very uneducated statement. Okay. I'm so sorry. These are not, I got my notes mixed up. Can I ask you this question? Can we start over and we ask you? Okay. What did you think when Donald Trump suggested that COVID could be cured by shining a bright light into the body? It depends what that technology is. That's a broad spectrum because, you know, you have MRI machines and CT machines and infrared and different things. So it just depends the context of that. What did you think of Donald Trump saying that getting through the 80s without getting HIV was his own personal Vietnam? Dementia patient? No, I don't believe that. There are accusations that Joe Biden cheated on his wife with a porn star after his son was born. And there's actually a paper trail showing he paid the sex worker $130,000 to keep quiet about it. Who did that? Joe Biden. And he was making, I think, less than $100,000 a year at that time as a congressman, I mean, senator. And how does he do that? You tell me. Would you vote for someone that- Of course not. Okay. So Trump did do that. Trump had a fling with Stormy Daniels. And paid her $130,000. Clutch money, yes. And you're voting for him. I am. My father had affairs too, and I still respect him. How do you feel about Joe Biden using his bone spurs to dodge the Vietnam draft? Joe Biden has a problem. He isn't an American. He isn't a patriot. I'm sorry, I asked you, I said Biden and I meant Trump. So those were things that- Oh, Trump? Yes. Can I ask you the question again with the right name? Yes, you may. I'm so sorry. How do you feel about Donald Trump using his bone spurs to dodge the Vietnam draft? My brother-in-law had flat feet.

He and his identical twin brother, Gary, were born on December 11, 1962, in Wabash, Indiana. They grew up on the edge of a cemetery, and by the time they were 12, they were digging graves with their father. After high school, Larry took a job as a janitor, but when he wasn't working, he and Gary hit the road, going town to town across the Midwest for Civil War and Revolutionary War reenactments. And near many of the towns they stopped in, a girl would go missing. A little over 19 miles from the place he was born and raised is a small Christian college called Indiana Wesleyan University. 19-year-old Trisha Reitler was a student there, and in the spring of 1993, she walked to a nearby store and bought a soda and a magazine. She was never seen or heard from again. Six months after that, three hours away in Georgetown, Illinois, 15-year-old Jessica Roach goes missing while riding her new bike. Weeks later, her badly decomposed body was discovered in a cornfield in Perrysville, Indiana, just over the state line. In November 1994, Georgetown police responded to a distress call from two teenage girls. A weird guy driving a van wouldn't leave them alone. When they ran his license plate, they discovered something shocking. Eleven girls in five different towns had reported the same thing. In late spring 1994, one of those complaints had put him on a police radar in Gas City, Indiana, just eight minutes from the place where Trisha Reitler disappeared. The next day, he confessed to her murder, and he even offered to show them where she was buried. But just when they thought they were about to close the case, Larry's confession fell apart. Suddenly, he couldn't take them to her body, so they kicked him loose. Five months later, he was back home in Wabash answering questions again. This time, it was about Jessica Roach. "

I wash my hair every two weeks with the shampoo and then go in with this keratin treatment. Let that sit in my hair for a few minutes, rinse that out, and then scrub my scalp. Before I go in with a deep conditioner, I like to make sure that my hair is just really really clean but also hydrated. And then I go in with a few other products after I've gotten out the shower. One of the things I hate doing is my hair. I don't know what it is. It hurts my arm. It's not fun. So Lucky offered to do my hair for me and blow it all out. People seem to think that I hate my curly hair or that I want to be more white by doing this. I don't. I used to have really really bad eczema on my scalp which caused me to lose a bunch of hair, constantly be flaky. So in order for me to feel confident, I decided to chop it all off and wear a style that would cover up the front of my hair, which is why I also haven't gotten braids in almost two years now because my scalp wouldn't have been able to handle it. But now, being pregnant, my eczema has not flared up in nine months which is great. So I decided to get some knotless braids for this baby's birth. I just don't want to be dealing with washing my hair or combing it out or doing anything. So I always get braids or a different protective style before I go into labor or go on holiday. I wanted to leave out some hair in the front to give it a feathery light look but I ended up not liking it and decided to just braid them all the way down. And ten hours later, we were done. And yes, my butt hurt but it was totally worth it. "

The justice is ruling that states cannot bar Donald Trump from running for another term, even though he is accused by some of insurrection. Colorado and several other states were seeking to disqualify Trump because of his actions surrounding the January 6th attack on the US Capitol. Now, today's decision was unanimous. All nine justices agreed that Trump cannot be barred from the ballot. And perhaps the most important ruling by the nation's highest court about a presidential election in more than two decades, since the decision of Bush versus Gore in 2000. This is the key paragraph of the ruling. States may disqualify persons holding or attempting to hold state office, but states have no power under the Constitution with respect to federal offices, especially the presidency. Now, the court's three liberal members say the court's majority went too far. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson expressed frustration in a concurring opinion, saying the decision protects Donald Trump from, quote, future controversy. "

7345998789108370730,"You begin tonight with the heated battle over the future of TikTok here in the U.S., 170 million users here in this country. Tonight the House, by an overwhelming majority, Democrats and Republicans, passing a measure to ban the Chinese-owned app here in the U.S., unless TikTok is sold to an American company within six months. The move sparking strong reaction from TikTok users, some protesting outside the Capitol, many arguing it's not just dancing videos and viral clips. Some say it's their livelihood, their business. TikTok fighting back tonight, a heavy lobbying effort on the Hill. But tonight, why does TikTok look so different in China than it does here in the U.S.? Why are there more restrictions, more protections for young people in China than in the U.S.? And if U.S. social media is banned in China, many are now asking, why allow a Chinese company to have such a large and influential presence here? Rachel Scott leading us off from the Hill tonight. The House overwhelmingly voting to ban TikTok, the wildly popular social media app, unless it's sold by its Chinese parent company ByteDance. Lawmakers responding to concerns TikTok poses a national security threat and compromises the data of its 170 million American users. This bill therefore forces TikTok to break up with the Chinese Communist Party. This is not an attempt to ban TikTok. It's an attempt to make TikTok better. Tic-tac-toe. A winner. A winner. The FBI and top intelligence officials sounding the alarm, warning the Chinese government could use TikTok to access Americans' personal information. The problem is their ability to manipulate you. They already manipulate your algorithm based on what you like. And that can be, that can be innocent. All social media companies do that to try and tailor your feed. It's a problem when, when, when the person in charge, the entity in charge of manipulating can be an adversary like the Chinese Communist Party. TikTok denies those allegations, but lawmakers now warning TikTok could interfere in the election. The risk in terms of propaganda, the risk to influence our election are just too severe. In China, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube are banned completely. And the version of TikTok available over there is much different from what we get here. Listen to how a former Google executive described what kids see on the Chinese version of TikTok in an interview with 60 Minutes. They show you science experiments you can do at home, museum exhibits, patriotism videos, and educational videos. And they make their domestic version a spinach version of TikTok, while they ship the opium version to the rest of the world. TikTok pushing back hard, a fierce lobbying effort on Capitol Hill. Online, users enraged. I'm like literally shaking, thinking about the possibility of this. Have there been talks about this before? Sure. This time, it's serious. We spoke with Brandon Hurst, who uses TikTok to promote his plant business. My whole business would be devastated. Yeah, I would lose the opportunity to connect with millions of people on a regular basis. And the community that I've worked really hard to build would be, would be gone. How much of your sales are driven from TikTok? 100 percent. President Biden recently launched his own campaign, TikTok, to meet young voters where they are. But he says that this bill lands on his desk. He will sign it. If they pass it, I'll sign it. As president, Donald Trump once tried to ban TikTok by executive order, but now he's against the possible ban. He says it would help Facebook, which he's railed against. But Trump's change in tune also comes after he met with a top Republican donor who has a major financial stake in TikTok's parent company. A lot to track there as well. Let's get right to Rachel Scott live up on the Hill tonight. Rachel, you heard the president there in his campaign. Obviously, they're on TikTok as well, as you pointed out, trying to reach younger voters. But the president, very clear, he says he's ready to sign this bill if the Senate passes it as well. Yes, David, and even with the president's support, there are no signs that the Senate will move quickly. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says they only plan to review this legislation. And tonight, China responding, blasting this move, insisting that it will only backfire on the U.S. But again, David, the version of TikTok that's available in China is largely educational and far different from what's available here in the U.S. David, a lot of strong opinions, but that's a very important point. Rachel, thank you. "

I do not in any way want to harm my parents' dog. When I left for university, I had to leave my dog behind with my parents. I was the last kid out of the house and they liked their empty nest. To make sure it was super empty, they put my dog down. She was a 6-year-old Beagle Basset Cross in perfect health. I had rescued her. I got a job to pay for her food and vet. Before I left, I had Quinn Tupple checked with my parents that they were okay taking care of her while I was at school. They were not. They told me she got out of the yard and was hit by a car. I found out the truth from my brother and I cut them out of my life. They killed my best friend. My friend from high school had offered to take her, but I didn't want to have her get attached and then have to fight to get my dog back. I honestly thought I could trust my parents. It's been 8 years since I talked to them. They were not invited to my wedding and I do not attend family gatherings when they are there. I have a 3-month-old son with my now husband. My brother and his family were over to meet him and they asked if I could ever forgive my parents. I said no. My mom contacted me and asked what it would take for me to forgive them and to let them meet their grandson. They have a French Bulldog puppy. I said that if they gave me their dog so that I could have it put down, then I would forgive them. She said that I was being ridiculous. That was not going to happen and I told her she cares more about a dog than her family, which is what she always accused me of. My brother says that I'm being an asshole, that they made a stupid mistake, and that it should be forgiven. I'm never going to get over it. "

Right now for those of you that are not aware, in Haiti there are gangs who have managed to capture over 80% of the capital of Haiti and probably going to be trying to capture more than just the capital. Essentially what's happening is these gang members have somehow gotten access to prisons and they are releasing more and more gang members and they are working together to capture more territory. Now there has been no evidence that they are going after specifically U.S. citizens, but what the United States is saying is they have a small garrison of U.S. Marines at the embassy. They can only do so much and their main priority right now are officials working within the embassy. Now it's not like the United States will never leave a U.S. member behind or U.S. citizens, but again, that's how it goes when these operations happen. The U.S. Marines need to protect the government buildings and the government officials, so if you are a U.S. citizen, try to hide in Haiti or try to get out. That's what the embassy is saying. "

And the residents are not happy. They lined the streets for his welcome with signs that say, a little too late. Dementia Joe has got to go. As you can see, there are tons of Trump signs as well. But the one that won the best sign, in my opinion, is this little girl who is holding up a sign that says, don't sniff me. Can't really blame her because we know he's had problems doing this in the past. Residents are saying that he's only here now because he's campaigning and they don't want to see him. Do you agree with them? Is it a little too late to visit? As always, let me know what you think about all of this down below. "

7350685354392833323,"Another big statement. The leader of Russia has put out yet again another public address talking about the attacks that occurred near Moscow, Russia. So here's what's going on. The leader of Russia has confirmed it was IS 100 percent, however, there's also this gray area where he's trying to connect the 2014 Kiev or Kiev regime. Now if you don't know what was happening back in 2014 between Ukraine and Russia, there was definitely a lot of engagement and conflicts on the eastern territories of Ukraine, Crimea and other parts of Ukraine. A lot of people seem to forget that happened, but it did happen. Now the reason why this is rather odd is that 2014 Ukraine and 2024 Ukraine are nowhere alike. Back in 2014 we saw a lot of corruption, 2024 there seems to be a little less corruption, not so much going on anymore, but again it looks like Russia is still somehow trying to tie the attacks that happened on Russian territory, possibly connecting it to Ukraine.

7338498643994971434,"Just yesterday something unbelievable happened. A sand mining vessel actually collided with and broke a bridge. Can you believe it? This is the scene of the accident, which occurred in Guangzhou, China. It is reported that the vessel, which was 60 meters long, was empty at the time of the collision. The captain has now been detained by the police. What do you think could have caused the collision? Sadly, at the time of the accident, there were three vehicles on the bridge that fell into the water, resulting in two deaths and three people missing who are currently being searched for. One of the vehicles was a bus which fell directly into the ship's hold. Fortunately, there was only the driver on the bus at the time. Given the current situation, the ship owner will face significant legal responsibility. An investigation afterwards found that the vessel was only traveling at a speed of five knots at the time of the accident, and yet, while empty, it managed to cause the bridge to collapse upon impact with a pier. I still can't believe this fact. Do you think it's due to poor bridge quality, or does the vessel's impact force really have such magnitude? What are your thoughts? "

7358538332013366570,"Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas suggesting Americans take matters into their own hands when it comes to pro-Palestinian protesters. If something like this happened in Arkansas on a bridge there, let's just say I think there'd be a lot of very wet criminals that have been tossed overboard, not by law enforcement, but by the people whose road they're blocking. If they glued their hands to a car or the pavement, well, probably pretty painful to have their skin ripped off. But I think that's the way we'd handle it in Arkansas, and I would encourage most people anywhere that gets stuck behind criminals like this who are trying to block traffic to take matters into their own hands. There's only usually a few of them, and there's a lot of people being inconvenienced. It's time to put an end to this nonsense. I'm thinking that's a little over the top. I don't know. Well, it's beyond that. I mean, police officers would be the first to say, don't do that. There are ways to protest, and there's ways, I think, not to protest. Here we have a guy, Tom Cotton, that went to Harvard, undergrad and law school, served in the military, who's talking about throwing people off the Golden Gate Bridge, suggesting that Americans rip skin off of people's hands and take matters into their own hands. This is just beyond stupid on his part, beyond dangerous. This shows how violence and violent rhetoric has become normal practice in the Republican Party.

Yet, the mother claimed that such items were just tricks to deceive children and that keeping the useless card was pointless. Despite the clerk feeling it was a shame to melt it and repeatedly emphasizing its commemorative value and potential as a keepsake for the child, the mother refused with a wave of her hand.At that point, the clerk suggested cutting the banknote in half to test it, keeping one half with the character to take home for the child. Eager to melt it down and verify its authenticity, the mother hurriedly agreed and urged the clerk to proceed. The clerk then baked the gold banknote and discovered it was made of real gold, which soon turned into golden beads resembling corn kernels in a bowl. After weighing it, the half banknote was handed to the mother, valued at 500 yuan. Hearing this, the mother's eyes lit up instantly, proud that her child's gaming was not in vain, and she quickly asked the clerk to melt the other half of the gold card. "

I started making my custard for my ice cream with some milk, vanilla, sugar, and some eggs. I combined my egg yolks with my sugar and then slowly put some of the warm milk in there just to get it warm, and then added it to the rest of my milk, strained all the vanilla out, and then let it come down to room temperature before transferring it over to the fridge. In the meantime, I started on my brownie batter, mixed all of my dry ingredients, and then added my wet ones, which were some eggs, some oil, and some water. I then combined that mixture with my dry ingredients, gave it a really good mix, and then transferred that over to my loaf pan before putting that in the oven. Then I pulled out my custard and churned it. When I hit the consistency of soft serve, I transferred it over to a separate container to pop it in the freezer for a couple hours. At this point, my brownie was good to go, so I pulled it out of the oven and let it cool completely. And then my husband walked through the door, so I decided to serve him up some of that brownie and ice cream. This is one of his favorite sweet treats, so I'm excited that he really liked it. "
7336118766679510318,"Do you know what crime was even more heinous than Usher's performance at the Super Bowl? During the Super Bowl, Israel bombed Rafah, the southernmost tip of the Gaza Strip, the place that Israel's been telling the world that they're not gonna bomb because they've been telling all the civilians in Gaza to evacuate there. Israel has a consistent history of planning attacks during times when the media's gonna be distracted, like during the Super Bowl. And since then, two Al Jazeera journalists have been severely injured in a drone strike that they said was a targeted attack on them. There is a terrifying reason why we're hearing less and less about the war crimes being committed in Gaza. And that's because there have been as many journalists killed in Gaza as World War II and the Vietnam War combined. That is just 2% of the total time of those wars, the same number of journalists killed. Less than half a year versus a total of 26 years in large-scale conflicts, this one territory, the Gaza Strip, that many journalists have been killed. Israel's not just fighting a war against Palestine. They're fighting a war against the truth. That's why we all can't stop paying attention. We cannot stop talking about Palestine. "

They're starving, they're malnourished as a result to the fact that humanitarian assistance can't get to them.

As world's ending, biblical structures are coming out of hiding, and everything we know about religion and science is all changing. People were terrified after archaeologists in Turkey found archaeological evidence showing proof that the Bible is actually real, and that the world could face a supernatural biblical ending with a date potentially already set. The Bible mentions one of the last locations Noah's Ark was left in was Turkey, and after archaeologists went there, they were terrified to discover a 513 feet creepy structure that was identical to the Bible's Ark that was buried deep underground, with the terrifying 3D scan done on site. Researchers were able to see an actual human-made boat under the ground, with marine equipment and food found inside, as well as several other internal measurements lining up exactly to what the Bible details, and even showing artifacts like rivet and petrified deck timber, which are only materials that were used to build boats in ancient times. Making people terrified at how this would be documented otherwise in times. Making people terrified at how this would be documented otherwise in the Bible before scientists even knew this boat existed. What do you think about this? "

So today I decided to act on it and make exactly what I was craving, which was papaya and lime whipped cream. So I started by zesting my lime and then adding some heavy cream to my mixer. Since I was craving something sour, I added a whole lime to my heavy cream and some powdered sugar. I got distracted at this point, so I over whipped my cream, but it was still fine. I added all of my lime zest into my cream and folded it in. Then I cut my very ripe papaya in half and deseeded it. There's nothing better than papaya and lime, so I added even more lime to my papaya before I spooned in my whipped cream. Just to give it a little bit more texture, I also added a sprinkle of coconut sugar on top. And this was so delicious, it was actually exactly what I was craving. And now watching this video back, I actually need to go make them again. "

First, I'm removing your glasses because I'm gonna give you a suggestion for better ones. Alright, now starting off, I'd suggest getting braces to help straighten out your teeth, as well as whitening them to appear cleaner. You can do this in a dental office or at home with whitening strips. Now for your hair, I'd suggest changing the color. Here, I'm giving you this dark brown because I think it'd suit you better, but you can always go with something else, like this blonde looks so, so good as well. I cut your hair shorter for a cleaner look and I just styled by blowing out for more volume. Next, I'm going in with some bronzer to add some warmth to your face and contour it to look smaller. For your brows, I'd suggest growing them out with a brow serum or castor oil. I'm just adding mascara to really bring out your eye color and make the eyes appear larger. If your lashes aren't this long, you can look into false lashes, especially in a doll eye style that makes eyes look bigger. Lastly, I'm just adding a pink lip tint to make your lips look more plump. Here's the end result. I love these same glasses that I used in the last video on YouTube. Here's them on that blonde hair as well. But anyways, look at that difference. If you want to glow up but don't want to post yourself or only get these useless comments, you can get a private makeover from me, link in bio. "

7356743717237312814,"It's just this little plastic thing. Barbie Doyle in Plymouth. These phones are not the one that I sent back. John Pignatello in Torrington. They had said I sent back an old Samsung, a damaged Samsung Android phone. And Ryan Nightingale in Rocky Hill were all hoping to trade in their iPhones for newer models last fall. They sent me a mailing label, and I put the phone in the box and brought it to the post office. Doyle even took this photo showing what she packed in the box. She says the phone you see here was her iPhone 12 Pro Max. But AT&T told her they never got it. They mailed her the box back, and this was inside. There isn't even anything inside. The only branding says Vortex. It's definitely not an iPhone. AT&T charged her $519, the balance remaining on the iPhone that disappeared. Pignatello had something similar happen times three. My wife had an iPhone 12 Pro Max. My daughter had an iPhone 12, and I had a 13 Pro Max. But AT&T told him none of those phones were turned in. He was sent back these instead. I thought it was a joke, to be honest. I thought this was like, this had to be a mistake. He knew it wasn't a joke when he got a notification that AT&T was charging him $895 total for the three iPhones. Nightingale wasn't sent his box back, but he says he was out $600 worth of credit for his iPhone 13. Only two things could have happened. It was either they made a mistake, or they're accusing me of fraud. The I-team reached out to AT&T to find out. We asked about all three cases. A spokesperson replied with the statement, our goal is to make the experience as simple as possible when customers need to return a device. We handle millions of returns a year without any issues. If there is ever a problem, we do our best to make it right. It wasn't long after that, Doyle, Pignatello, and Nightingale all got calls from AT&T. Once you guys got involved, they reacted within hours. They all say AT&T has now adjusted their accounts to give them the full credit for their old iPhones. They just said, yeah, people make mistakes, and that was their explanation. It's still unclear where the Android phones came from. In the last year, Better Business Bureau says it's received 3,800 complaints about AT&T trade-ins across the country. People save up for these iPhones. They're $1,200, $1,000. They buy them for Christmas, for their kids, and things like that. So it's not like, it's not jump change. Even though his own case has been resolved, Nightingale will do things differently next time. Do as much as you can in person. You give up some control once you send it off to a, you know, somewhere where you don't know who's gonna receive it, how they're gonna handle it, what's gonna happen. I don't think I'll ever do that again. AT&T suggests saving your shipping receipt and tracking number whenever you ship a phone, although all three of the people in this story did that, and it didn't help them.

The investigator also suggesting that the acting police chief be exonerated. ABC's Maria Villarreal from Texas now. These are the dramatic images of the first Uvalde officers entering Rob Elementary, being met with gunfire and retreating, then waiting a total of 77 minutes before breaching the door. But tonight, a new independent report finding that those officers did nothing wrong, sparking outrage again in Uvalde. How dare you? How dare you? You were paid by them. At a pack council meeting, retired Detective Jesse Prado, hired by the city to investigate the deadly rampage that killed 19 Children and two teachers, detailing multiple failures by law enforcement, but finding that none of those officers violated policy. There were no indications of wrongdoing in any of his actions. There was no evidence of serious acts of misconduct, even saying acting chief of police Mariano Pargas, who resigned weeks after the shooting, should be exonerated. Kim Rubio, whose daughter Lexi was killed and other families demanding the council still take action against the officers. Do what's right. Terminate them. David, two of the council members went so far as to say they do not accept or agree with the findings of this report, calling it insulting and embarrassing. The mayor just told me right now, however, they do not plan to make any decisions until everyone can fully digest this report and they can have their next council meeting, which is set for next Tuesday. David Maria Villarreal tonight. Maria, thank you. "

And with me and the elected cabinet of Israel. And we're doing that. A lot of things that we were told by the best of friends initially turned out not to be true. They said you can't enter the ground war without having enormous complications. They said you cannot fight. You can't enter Gaza City. You can't go into the tunnels. It'll be a terrible bloodbath.

People were terrified as NASA just announced that we have outlived our time on Earth and we were not supposed to make it past July 23, 2012, as something catastrophic was 100 in line to hit us causing the end of humanity. And the damages would be a person's worst nightmare on Earth, as all of our trees would have caught on fire, oxygen levels might have dropped because of that, technology would have failed, and the planet would be left without any water. With NASA reporting this haunting phrase saying if it had, we would still be picking up the pieces now, it was reported that the sun had ejected a huge flaming ball that was twice bigger, twice as strong and dubbed as the fastest ball in recorded history and aimed right at the center mass of Earth. However, it gets creepier as during the last minute somehow the ball hit something in front of Earth and the ball was pushed out and missed the Earth just marginally. Scientists were terrified saying if the sun had shot this ball even just several days before, nothing would have been in line to protect us. What do you think about this? "

7357026311220612394,"World War 3 could start this weekend as Western media has lit up with news about hundreds of drones dropping missiles in mainland Israel as a retaliation from Iran, US aircraft carriers are also seen patrolling the waters in the Middle East in anticipation of Iran's retaliation. So now that we have the salacious headline out of the way, let's actually double click and see if an attack is actually going to happen this weekend. So Iran isn't stupid and it is not going to attack when an attack is expected. The Iranians have patience unlike the Americans and the Israelis and every day they are not at war is a gain for Iran and a loss for Israel as it gets more and more panicked and less liked by the international community. So this puts the Israelis in a permanent state of panic as they are saying that today we must focus less on the situation in Gaza and we are preparing for Iran. Let's imagine the scenario where the Ayatollah goes completely crazy and attacks Israel. Then the United States will launch an all out attack against Iran. Let's see what that would look like. On Iran's east you have Turkmenistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan all really hostile to the United States and a big no no. In the south is the Persian Gulf which Iran completely dominates so that's a no as well. To Iran's west you have Turkey and Iraq again a big no no as Iraq will not help the United States and the Turkish government will not risk its safety and potentially angering its people by giving support to the United States to go and invade Iran. The US will only have to rely completely on its air superiority over Iran and it's going to be very very difficult. Just think how difficult it's been for Russia to control and take over Ukraine which it borders. Now think how much harder it would be for Russia to go and invade Ukraine if Ukraine was thousands of miles away. If you're thinking that the conflict would only stay in Iran you are mistaken. Iran can and will hit mainland US if Iran is attacked. All of the US military bases surrounding Iran for them it will be 10,000 October 7th every day. "

7345848127401987374,"Here's why Saudi Arabia and the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will not only sell out the Palestinians but they will also normalize relationship with the blue and white. It's cause MBS was promised nuclear weapons by the United States and the West if he normalizes relationship and recognizes the blue and white. And it's an open secret in the Arab world that MBS is trying his best to acquire nuclear weapons and even with all of his wealth it's not easy because if he tries to buy one or build one it'll basically alert the United States and the West and they can come and stop him. The United States also has a humongous caveat, actually there's two, one of them is legal, the United States cannot legally sell nuclear weapons to any other country and the other one is that the United States really wants Saudi Arabia to be dependent on the United States for its security and if it acquires nuclear weapons it'll be security independent. But the United States has no choice but to bend its knee to the Israeli lobby and the Israeli government because according to the blue and white their main target in normalizing relations with all of the nations of the Arab world is to first normalize it with Saudi Arabia because, you know, they are kind of the de facto big brother of the Sunni world and once they get Saudi Arabia on their side they want to use Saudi Arabia and their joint coalition to basically topple Iran and control all of the Middle East.

7346019169751665963,"to take some time before there would be any sort of ban on TikTok, because the way this would have to work is that after passage of the House, which happened today, it would need to go on to the Senate. The Senate would have to pass it, then the president would have to sign it. And then even after that happens, the clock would then begin for a six-month period by which TikTok would have to be divested by the Chinese parent company ByteDance. If they can't do that, then it will be banned. If they can do that, then things go on un-distorted. We can continue to post our dancing videos on TikTok. But look, at the end of the day, the question is, OK, so if this does look like it has a pact to being passed and signed into law by the president, which the president said he would do, who might buy TikTok? And we have to remember that there is precedent for this because then-President Donald Trump in 2020 tried to do the exact same thing, which was force ByteDance to divest TikTok. And when he tried to do so, there were two potential suitors that were named, Oracle and also Walmart. So there is potentially a market for this company to be sold. But again, how this plays out in 2024, we'll have to see. "

Two officers have been shot and the home they were responding to now engulfed in flames. The government opening fire as soon as police arrived. It's believed an 11 year old girl was shot inside. Here's ABC's Ariel Reshef. Tonight, this home outside Philadelphia engulfed in flames after a horrific ordeal that left two officers shot and injured. Authorities saying the officers arrived to this East Lansdowne home just before 4 p.m. responding to a report of an 11 year old girl shot inside. The officers immediately coming under fire from the suspect. It was rapid gunfire. Cops were coming from everywhere, every direction, yelling active shooter, close your door. Minutes after the shooting, the home on fire. Chopper video capturing an officer being brought to an ambulance. A SWAT vehicle seen breaking down windows and a wall. Firefighters trying to control the blaze. Still too dangerous for us to go inside and do any further investigation. I will say with a heavy heart that we are afraid there might be more than one person in that house. We know the victim's family had a lot of people living in that house, including children. We are aware that there are at least six to eight people who are unaccounted for from that family. Tonight, those two officers are in the hospital in stable condition. "

My name is Jailen Candelario, and I was 16 months old when my mother betrayed and abandoned me. On 6 June 2023, she left home with her suitcase to go on a trip to Detroit, Michigan and Puerto Rico. She left me in my playpen with a few bottles of milk and didn't tell anyone. While she was enjoying her holiday on the beach, I was struggling to survive and was full of distress. A neighbor's doorbell camera even captured my scream several times over the course of a week. When she came back 10 days later, she found me in a very bad state and called the emergency services. The paramedics who attended couldn't believe it. I was lying on a mattress covered in urine and excrement. My eyes were sunken in, my lips were dry, I had faecal matter in my mouth, and I weighed 7 pounds less. It came as no surprise when they pronounced me dead. My mother wouldn't stop crying, but it was she who had killed me. The police said it was the most terrible case they'd ever investigated, and the judge handed down a life sentence without the possibility of parole.

And this is because your arms are really just legs but on the other side of your body. I think most gym bros are just really insecure and are going to tell you to do your workout a certain type of way or you won't make any progress, and I disagree. But from my experience, doing what's most comfortable for me is going to give you the fastest amount of progress. I've tried countless ways to work out my arms, and at the end of the day, the leg extension machine just gives me the biggest pump out of any other machine. So stop getting mad at me when I'm probably going to be way bigger than you in a few months. "

So I combine all of my dry ingredients into a bowl, give that really good mix, and then slowly add some oil and water. I incorporate everything with my spatula and then move on to using my hands. Then I add in the cinnamon and make sure it's incorporated before putting my dough on some parchment paper. I use another sheet of parchment paper on top and roll it out as thin as I can. Once it's rolled out, I'm using a pizza cutter to just cut it into squares or rectangles. You can do it in whatever shape you want. I ended up making two batches, sprinkled it with some sweetener. You can use sugar. I used monk fruit sweetener. I put it on my parchment paper and baked in the oven at 350 for about 10 minutes before I turned it down to 250 and baked it for another 35. I pulled it out the oven, let it cool, and then broke the squares apart before adding them to bowls with some milk. This is now a favorite in our house. "
7351497005643910442,"Toddlers requested some yogurt this morning and we were running low so I just decided to make it myself. They always have to have granola with their yogurt so I made that first by adding some oats, cinnamon, maple syrup, a smidge of peanut butter, some coconut oil, some coconut flakes. I gave that a really good mix and also decided to add some peanuts in there as well. I transferred that over to my baking sheet, pressed it down, and then popped that in the oven. In the meantime, I poured some milk into my pot and heated that up on the stove. Once that barely reached a simmer, I let that cool off, pulled out my granola, sprinkled it with some cherries, cranberries, and some more coconut flakes. When my milk was lukewarm, I combined some of the leftover yogurt I have with the warm milk before pouring it back into my milk, covering that with a towel and letting it rest in a warm place for a few hours. By this time, my granola had cooled enough for me to break it up and put it away in a glass jar. Depending on the consistency you want your yogurt to be, you can let it sit for about six hours or overnight before popping it in the fridge for another few hours. Once I pulled my pot out of the fridge, I gave the yogurt a good mix and it was ready to serve. Put some yogurt in the bowls, topped it with the granola, added some raspberries, and obviously a drizzle of honey. I popped any leftovers in the fridge and they were so excited to have them. "

There's no point kind of fighting for a country when you could be sitting in a dugout having lunch with some of your comrades, and the next thing you know, a drone flies over that you don't hear and drops a overwhelming clusterfuck on top of you, killing you and everyone around you.

7339963987880299822,"Have y'all seen this viral clip of Candace Owens getting owned at one of her debates? Because it illustrates how the violent and hateful transphobia from conservatives is built off of ignorance, white supremacy, and historical revisionism. But um, can you explain to me what two-spirit is in the history? I'm telling you that not only in one Native American tribe, but in multiple tribes, there were dozens of terms that referred to people that would now be considered trans and that was hundreds of years ago, so I'm just wondering why you think that people are only trans now because the media is telling them to be? Well I told you, because of the proliferation, so you can't just go from having 0% to suddenly 25% of people. But what I'm saying is that these people were around for thousands of years. Well what you're saying is that some Native American tribes had people that would be considered trans today. People that were trans. Something that we can't fact-check because they're dead. It's historical knowledge. It's historical knowledge that there were trans Native Americans? Yes. I really don't think that's historical knowledge. But here's what I'll answer. I don't think that there were trans Native Americans. Well I'm telling you that there were, so if you could educate yourself a little more you would know that as well. Okay. I will educate myself. And to be clear, Kenneth Owens is completely wrong. Two-spirit refers to individuals who have neither identified as men nor women since pre-colonial times in North America and their existence is very well documented. On top of that, Native Americans are not all dead and many today identify as two-spirit. Now it's important to know that conservatism thrives on rhetorical attacks against aspects of society that are deemed new or recent and also romanticizes aspects of society that are older or more traditional. As a clear example, Make America Great Again was a slogan for both Donald Trump and Ronald Reagan because it romanticizes the idea of upholding a set of traditional values from the past. But just to be clear, there's no inherent logic to this worldview which is why conservatives were the champions of conserving things like slavery and Jim Crow. With that being said, it's clear that this same tactic is being used by conservatives to demonize queer and specifically trans people by attaching trans identity to some sort of recent media agenda or new social contagion. This hateful line of thinking is what has exacerbated discrimination against LGBTQ plus individuals and drove the brutal assault of a Native American teenager named Next Benedict which led to their death. And may Next Benedict rest in power. But perhaps the worst irony behind all of this is that it's based on historical revisionism and lies. Even when engaging with a conservative worldview, it's clear that many homophobic and transphobic people are completely ignorant of the history of these identities. People that would now be considered trans or queer have existed across the world and throughout time. In India, third gender individuals or hijras have been documented in Hindu holy texts for over 2,000 years and were revered and respected in their society, including by rulers from other religions, specifically Islam. In some of the oldest societies of the world made up of the Aboriginal peoples of Australia, there are sister girls and brother boys who represent ideas of gender that are even hard to conceptualize with the limited Western perspective on the man-woman binary. And last but not least, yes, Africa is a continent full of examples of civilizations that included people that did not exist within the man-woman binary, including the Mudoko-Dako of modern-day Uganda and the Djinbanda of Central Africa, but there are so many more examples. In fact, PBS has a map detailing much of the gender diversity that exists across the world showing that no, queer and trans identities existing is nothing new. But what is more recent, however, is the transphobia and homophobia brought forth by colonization and imperialism that demonize and criminalize these identities. And what I find incredibly sad is that because historical revisionism and fundamentalism are so prevalent in colonial societies like the United States, some people who are woke on other issues actually believe that being trans is something new or some sort of novel deviation from the norm. The conservative superintendent of NYSE's district in Oklahoma illustrates a perspective that many people have when he says, And even though he declares himself a lover of history, it's clear that this superintendent only knows history through a lens of white supremacy and Christian hegemony. Like Kenneth Owens, he must be completely ignorant of the vast gender diversity that exists and has existed across the world otherwise he would realize that his statement is just not based in any actual human history. The only credit I'll give him is that there is a clear analog between the work that he's doing and the work of the founders of this country. Because just as they sought to violently erase the cultural heritage of the peoples they subjugated, conservatives today are continuing to suppress and demonize identities that were openly expressed across many of our ancestors before colonization.

This just one day after retaliatory strikes against dozens of sites in Syria and Iraq following the deaths of three U.S. service members in Jordan. Here you can see before and after satellite images of one of those strikes in Syria by American forces. And the devastation on full display in Iraq, burnt out cars and destroyed buildings. This long-range supersonic B-1 bomber taking off overnight to take part in those airstrikes. But so far the Houthi rebels have made it clear they have no intention of scaling back their assaults in the Red Sea. ABC's Marcus Moore in Jordan tonight. Just hours ago, officials confirming that U.S. and British forces, supported by six other countries, have unleashed a new large-scale attack on Houthi targets in Yemen. American F-18 fighter jets and warships with the Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group firing guided Tomahawk missiles striking 13 different locations. U.S. Central Command forces also saying earlier they struck six Houthi anti-ship cruise missiles prepared to launch and destroyed 12 Houthi drones on Friday, either mid-flight or ready to be launched from Yemen. Those drones a serious threat to international trade transiting through the Gulf of Aden. Parts of Iraq and Syria today also waking up to the sound of American missiles. After several days of warning, the U.S. retaliating against Iran-backed proxies, blaming them for carrying out the drone strike that killed three service members at an army outpost in Jordan a week ago. In the Iraqi town of Al-Qa'im, 200 miles from Baghdad, burned out cars and buildings reduced to rubble. The destruction left by some of the 125 guided munitions used in the strike. This resident claiming there was an explosion of equipment and rockets stored by an Iraqi paramilitary group made up predominantly of Shiite Muslims who want the United States out of the region. That secondary explosion possibly seen here in videos circulating online. But the White House signaling last night that more strikes are coming. We will not hesitate to defend our people and hold responsible all those who harm Americans. These responses began tonight, but they're not going to end tonight. In all, three sites in Iraq and four in Syria were targeted. This long-range supersonic B-1 bomber taking off overnight to participate in an airstrike. These satellite images taken before and after showing the scope of the bombardment over one Syrian town. A Syrian human rights group saying 29 members of Iranian-backed militias were killed, while Iraqi officials say at least 16 people were killed there, including civilians. Arguing the strike violates Iraq's sovereignty. Though President Biden has repeatedly said he does not seek direct conflict with Iran, Iran's foreign ministry saying overnight the American barrage, quote, is a threat to regional and international peace and security. Still, Iran not yet vowing to retaliate. Marcus Moore joining us now from Jordan. And Marcus, other groups aligned with Iran in the Middle East also responding tonight. That's right. Hezbollah and Hamas are among those groups condemning the retaliation. And I think it signals just how much the Israel-Hamas war is playing a direct role in everything we've seen happen in the region. And there's more news coming from Yemen tonight. U.S. officials saying they targeted deeply buried weapons storage facilities and air defense systems there in Yemen, and with, there may be more yet to come. All eyes on the Middle East. Marcus, thank you so much. "

Because of this eruption, sometime during today, the ejection from the sun will collide with Earth's atmosphere and we will start to experience GPS and radio disruptions. Geomagnetic storms are measured by strength on a scale that varies from anywhere from a G1 to a G5, with G1 being a minor storm and G5 being extreme. The storm that will be taking place later on is expected to be a G2 or with a possible chance of a G3. On a positive note, one of the effects of this, is this might have, is actually on the Aurora Borealis, as today, it might be able to be seen further south from the North Pole in places like Illinois and Oregon. But that's only if this is a G3 storm, if this is G2, it will not be visible. Now for anyone worrying, this is nothing to be concerned about. At most you might have some GPS and radio disruptions for a little bit today, and some possible voltage problems at power grids, but for the most part, there is no need for concern over this geomagnetic storm.

7344364295112822062,"CNN's Clarice Ward went to speak to those from the blue and white who are blocking aid at the Gaza border and it got pretty interesting. So, Clarice Ward starts off the interview by asking them why they're blocking the aid and they basically say we're blocking the aid because all of it goes to Hamas and that Clarice Ward basically said there is no evidence to support that claim. One of the aid blockers seen here then goes on to say she doesn't believe that and that there should only be a minimum amount of calories that should be allowed in for the people to survive and then she goes on to say that there is no humanitarian crisis and even if there was she still supported not sending food to them. Clarice Ward then pushes back and says that you do know all of the world is appalled by what you're doing, we just cannot understand how people can see the images of the babies and restrict aid from going in. I'm paraphrasing here, those were not her exact words but you get the point. And she basically says that the only baby she cares about is the one year old that is under Hamas' custody and that she's willing to sacrifice all of the babies from Gaza for that one baby. And this is just classic Hasbara or the blue and whites propaganda method of just gaslighting you to death. And if you follow pro-Palestinian content you have seen that the comments have gotten extremely toxic over the last few weeks. This is because the government of the blue and white have hired tens and thousands of Indians and Sri Lankans in click farms to basically go and create fake social media profiles and to do Hasbara in all of our comment section.

7345570364954545451,"If TikTok gets banned, would you still be able to use it through a VPN? So the answer to this question is technically yes, but there is a big problem. If you don't know, a VPN encrypts your internet connection and sends it through a server in a different country, which makes it look like you're in a different location. So if TikTok gets banned in the US, a VPN should at least let you use the TikTok website. The only problem is that most VPNs have pretty mediocre internet speeds, and if 150 million people are trying to access TikTok through a VPN, it's probably going to be straight up unusable. Plus, the government still has time to amend the bill and block VPN companies from being able to provide access to TikTok from in the US. I'm not really sure how they would do this, but this is the first time the US government has tried to ban an app, so no one really knows what to expect. And what's even crazier is that the bill is already going to be voted on tomorrow in the House, and it's probably going to pass. If it does, it'll then go to the Senate, where it'll probably also pass, and then finally go to President Biden, who has already said he'll sign it into law. If they pass it, I'll sign it. I don't think these lawmakers truly understand how massive of a deal this is. Like, if they actually ban TikTok, thousands of American small businesses are going to have to shut down, and tons of creators are going to lose their careers. Luckily for me, I'm pretty established on other platforms, so I'll be okay, but there are some people who will literally have to start from scratch.

7327397121571835178,"Do you remember when Justin Trudeau and the Canadian government froze the bank accounts of the truckers and the Canadians that were protesting against the COVID-19 mandates? Well today a court ruled that that decision was unconstitutional. To refresh your memory in 2022 the Canadian government told Canadians that in order to cross the U.S. border you had to be vaccinated. So the truckers started a protest blocking roadways, major roadways including the Ambassador Bridge to Detroit and many Canadian freedom fighters joined in. The Canadian government then declared a national emergency giving them the rights to freeze hundreds of bank accounts and financial assets to the people that they believed were involved in the protests. Many different organizations then sued the government saying that this was unconstitutional and today the courts ruled that it absolutely was. Justice Richard Mosley wrote in a ruling on Tuesday, I conclude that there was no a national emergency justifying the invocation of the Emergencies Act and the decision to do so was therefore unreasonable. This ruling is a big win for Canada and a big win for freedom. As always let me know what you think about all of this down below. "

There's all this hysteria on both sides of the aisle right now about the migrant crisis coming here. These were men that came here and took jobs in the freezing cold at night to repair a bridge that Americans used to get to work. And they died through some freak accident. And I definitely don't want to hear any conspiracy theories about how a barge bound from Sri Lanka from Baltimore was intentionally crashed into a bridge. It was a freak accident. And you know who got killed? Migrants. People that came here illegally to work their asses off to make the country better. Not like you would ever do that, would you? Oh my God. The people in your comments being like, they just got to do it legally, you know? It's like, oh, you have a gun pressed to your temple from a gang member in Honduras and you're like, man, maybe I should flee for a better life. And when you get to America, you work a job that we desperately need. And what? They're just going to die nameless, faceless. No one's going to honor them. Not all these right wing reactionaries, right? It's such horseshit. Migrants make the country stronger. "

Two weeks ago on January 29th, she was in Gaza City, loading up into a car with her aunt, uncle, and some cousins to flee south to get away from the fighting. As they were in the car, an Israeli tank approached them and opened fire on their car. Hind's 15-year-old cousin called the Red Crescent, begging to be rescued. And as he was on the phone, he was killed. Hind was the only one left alive, and she called the Red Crescent back, asking to be rescued. And with approval from the Israeli occupation forces, Red Crescent sent two medics in an ambulance to go rescue Hind. But they lost contact with the medics, lost contact with the ambulance. When the rest of Hind's family went back to see what happened to Hind, they found her in the car, riddled with bullet holes, murdered by Israeli forces. And just yards away was the ambulance sent by the Red Crescent, both medics also killed by Israeli forces. Israel murders children. They murder families. They murder civilians and medics and doctors. You can listen to Hind and her cousin's phone calls with the Red Crescent online. Make sure you repost and copy the links so more people see this video. But that's all. Thank you, and free Palestine.

For some reason, Congress has made banning the dancing clock app their number one priority in life despite us having real world issues going on. For instance, homelessness, specifically in San Francisco. And let's not forget how basically no one can afford rent anymore, including myself because I still live with my parents and I realize that that makes me one of the lucky ones. And let's not forget about inflation, and all the wars that are currently happening. Which honestly begs the question, who puts these people in power because I don't remember voting for them? Regardless, Biden announced that if the House of Representatives approves the bill to ban TikTok, he will approve it as well. Meanwhile, surprisingly, Trump is totally against banning the app. It's also important to point out that literally every single social media app, including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, all sell our data, allegedly. But because TikTok is the only one that is used by hundreds of millions of Americans, mainstream media companies want it gone because it means it takes away from their ad revenue. The good news is, even if Biden does approve TikTok getting banned, it will take at least five months to go into effect because they are given that time to sell to a different company. However, if the CEO of TikTok is willing to sell is a whole nother question. "

The most important thing when it comes to doing gua sha is to make sure that the surface of the area you're working on is very slippery so that the gua sha doesn't tug at your skin and cause irritation. And it also leaves your face so glowy. Look at my mom's skin. Believe it or not, she's 51. So after applying the oil all over the face and neck, we always start with the neck area, which a lot of people forget to do. So much of the tension we hold on our necks gets reflected in the face. So we really take our time opening up that area before moving on to the face. Plus, massaging this area just feels so relaxing. Now for the face, we love to start on the forehead to relieve the tension on our head. When doing this, we always scrape outwards to the temples and hairline, and we repeat the movements about five to 10 times total. And after that, we like going to the eye area to help with puffiness and circulation. So first we do it under the eyes and then over the brows about five times each. And if you're not familiar with gua sha, it's actually an ancient Chinese medicine practice that focuses on blood circulation, lymphatic drainage, and those things can help with anti-aging properties. My mom and I's favorite part about gua sha is the tension relief that it gives. We both tend to clench our jaw muscles quite a lot, and doing gua sha in that area really helps with blood circulation. And doing this consistently has definitely helped with the tension relief, and it also helps with a more contoured and lifted look. So it's a win-win situation here. And yeah, we try to do gua sha at least once a week, and so far we've been loving the results. "

With the robot already reported to have the ability to recognize tools, and potentially weapons, touch and hold them, have spatial awareness, and ability to process and understand problems faster than humans can. Many people were horrified saying this is it for humanity, as the robot also moves and even stutters and says um when thinking, just like a person, with the manufacturers saying their goal is to make a robot even more lifelike, to learn and understand humans better. OpenAI and BMW have admitted they are optimistic for the robot to enter the workforce, and potentially replace some people's jobs.

Not only are they super convenient and versatile, one of my favorite things about these solid butter sticks is how long they last. I've started to get feedback from others who've had their stick going for a little over a month now and they use it every time they wash their hands. Most are only halfway through their sticks. I tried really hard to make these as affordable as possible and I currently have 18 different scent options, including unscented.

Now, Elizabeth and Reverend Charles Sennett, they were a staple in the community. Married for 26 years, she was his rock. She came into his life after his first wife died, and together, she and Charles welcomed two sons. When the cops arrived, the scene was grim. No sign of a pulse on Elizabeth, yet by some miracle, she was clinging to life by the thinnest thread. The EMTs found a whisper of a heartbeat and didn't waste a second getting her to the hospital, racing against time to pull her back from the edge. Now, you'd think her husband would be over the moon at the news, right? But get this. The guy nearly hit the deck when he heard his wife's heart was still beating. Odd, don't you think? One of the detectives hopped into the ambulance, hoping against hope Elizabeth might spill some crucial detail on the ride. But sadly, she never got the chance. The hospital declared her gone not long after they arrived. Chuck Sennett, her oldest boy at 25 and serving in the Navy, was floored. He was used to checking in with his mom almost every day. And then there's Mike, the younger brother, who was 23. He got the kind of call at work that turns your whole world upside down. Something's gone down at the farm with mom. Get there fast. The investigators turned that crime scene inside out for days. Only a VCR and a stereo were missing amidst all that chaos. It made zero sense. Or did it? Sometimes the truth is hiding in plain sight. You just gotta know where to look. And the cops were looking at her husband. Reverend Charles Sennett Sr., the man behind the pulpit at Westfield Church of Christ in Charming Shetfield, was a familiar face around town. His wife Elizabeth was the epitome of the pastor's wife. A bit on the quiet side, a true American homemaker teaching the boys the difference between right and wrong with a soft touch. With the kids off making their own way in the world, Charles and Elizabeth lived a simple life, getting by on what Charles made from his sermons and a handful of rental properties and investments they had here and there. But here's where the plot thickens. Charles was leading a double life. Buried under a mountain of debt that soared to $200,000, he was also tangled up in a love affair with a woman from his own congregation. He confided in her, pouring out his unhappiness and dreaming of a fresh start together. To top it off, Charles borrowed $3,000 from her, claiming it was to square off a bank loan. "

One is Japanese and the other is Korean. And they're both so popular. So my mom and I wanted to test them out to see which one gives you the softest hair. First up is the Japanese hair mask. My mom and I already tried this mask and loved every single part of it. This is the Fino hair mask and it leaves your hair so freaking smooth, guys. The texture is very light so you can easily spread it all over your hair. I apply it on the scalp, on the roots, on the tips, everywhere. And now it's time for the second mask. This is the Korean hair mask and it has like a collagen protein treatment. And apparently, it's so good at repairing hair damage and it's so popular in Korea. And I can't believe it's only $7 here in the U.S. And this was my mom and I's first time trying this mask. The texture is more like regular conditioner. But you're supposed to apply this mask everywhere, not just the ends. And now that we applied both hair masks on each side of our hair, we're gonna wait 10 minutes and then rinse it off very well. You don't need to shampoo after because I already shampooed my hair before applying the hair mask. And guys, how is my hair already this soft on wet hair? We couldn't wait to see the final results so we blow-dried our hair. You guys, look at how beautiful our hair turned out. It looks really soft but it feels even softer. It's so soft, oh my god. And now it's time for my mom and I to compare the results. So they both made our hair really, really soft. But both my mom and I think that the $7 Korean hair mask made our hair feel a little bit softer. But regardless, they're both so affordable and both give you hair salon quality hair. "

7349715155153931551,"Hey ladies and gentlemen, Carmine Sabia here for Explain America and Michelle Obama just found herself humiliated with a new photo leak. Before we get started, please make sure ladies and gentlemen that you like, comment, share and subscribe. I know I ask that all the time, but these little things really matter and they really help our channel grow. So Michelle Obama went on a rampage after the Supreme Court knocked down Affirmative Action. It was ludicrous, absolutely ridiculous. She whined and she cried about oppression and justice and equality and all these beautiful things that, you know, for the most part, I think we all stand for those things, right? But she talked about how it was denied to people like her. How she struggled. Oh, her struggle. And she talked so much about her struggle. And you know, Barack Obama, the former president, you know what he did? She writes this long screed, okay? This super long screed. And he writes two sentences and retweets her like the beta male that he is. Oh, I have nothing to say, here's my wife. It's so, so infuriating to see a man behave that way. You know, it's all my wife, forget about me. So ridiculous. But anyway, she went on this long screed about her oppression and, you know, I felt for her. I thought to myself, how does Michelle Obama get by with this crippling oppression that she faces on a daily basis? But then, then I found out a little something something. See, I was scrolling the web, getting ready to do one of these videos for you guys. And I came across some photographs. You can find these photographs on our website. I'm gonna go ahead and link that in the comments. If you go to our website, read the story, there's a link in there to the photographs. Just follow the breadcrumbs, it'll take you to it. The photographs of Michelle Obama and her husband Barack Obama, the former president, in Greece on vacation with Tom Hanks, and it gets even better. It gets even better. Not only is she on vacation in Greece with Tom Hanks and her husband, they took a yacht to get there. A yacht. And the people who were there had to ask permission from security before they could even go to the bathroom. Absolute ridiculousness, ladies and gentlemen. You know, when I hear somebody like her talk about oppression, I'm sorry, it's very hard for me to take it seriously. I understand that things might have happened in your life, but for you, on your perch, to come up, first of all, let's not even talk about the carbon emissions you're giving off in a yacht, and probably the leer private jet you took to get there. Let's not even talk about that, because it's good enough for you guys. You guys can do whatever you want. It's us peasants who have to follow your ridiculous rules. So when I hear her talk about oppression, yeah, you know what, Michelle, you made it. You made it. Game over. So we're tired of hearing from you, and you should be embarrassed.

7344185134641433898,"ultra-religious have been looking for a red cow to perform the sacrificial ceremony and bring about the end times in the past, but this situation is a lot more different. They believe the cow has to be perfectly red until three to four years of age during Passover, and in 2018 they were just born. This time, they still have four candidates left that are within three to four years in age a month before Passover. There are two even more important things beyond this. Some evangelical Christians are actually celebrating and believe what's happening in Gaza right now is a prelude to Armageddon. They've already even built the sacrificial altar. Time has to actually sync up to when they can build the temple, and that means destroy the mosque. Never in history has its structural integrity been so weak that it's very at risk of collapse. The past year, Israel's been actually accelerating the speed at which it's digging underneath the mosque, which now poses an existential threat. To me, it seems like they're accelerating the excavation to make the mosque collapse around the time the prophecy is supposed to be performed. The last most important that I think makes the situation more unique than ever before is Israel's actually approaching its 80th year. Religious sects believe in history the previous two kingdoms of Israel's downfall initiated on the 80th year. This country of Israel's 80th year is in 2028, and Netanyahu even warned people about that in a speech. I've been going through Reddit. Some of them do believe this prophecy must happen before 2028 and have it sync up with the mosque's collapse. "

7345863030212775210,"It's done. The bill that will essentially ban TikTok has just passed the United States House of Representatives. And it wasn't even close. But before you freak out, this is not over. TikTok is not going anywhere just yet. This bill is not going to become law today. So I'm going to explain what's next in a second, which is very important. But first, the final vote on H.R. 7521, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, was 352 to 65. One member voted present. The Republicans got this over the finish line with 197 yes votes and 155 Democrat yes votes. Fifty Democrats voted no, and so did 15 Republicans. Fourteen members were not voting on this bill today. Now because of the special procedures used to fast-track this bill to the House floor, the bill needed two-thirds majority, which obviously you can see it got. Now here's the thing. This bill will now move on to the United States Senate. And in order for it to become a law, it has to pass in the Senate, and then the president has to sign it. President Biden has already said he will sign this bill if it gets to his desk. So that's not a question. But what is a question is whether this bill can get the 60 votes it needs to pass in the Senate. Right now, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says he's not in any rush to fast-track this bill the way they did in the House. He said this bill will face the normal Senate timing, which includes several procedural votes and more than 30 hours of debate on the Senate floor. On top of this, the Senate is going to be on recess three of the next six weeks, and they quite honestly have bigger fish to fry right now, including the budget bill to avoid a government shutdown on March 22nd, and funding for Ukraine and Israel, which is really important to the Senate Majority Leader. Now I also want to make it very clear, supporters of this bill keep stressing over and over and over again this is not a ban on TikTok. They say this bill just simply forces the Chinese-owned parent company of TikTok, ByteDance, to divest or sell its interest in TikTok to another company the U.S. government determines is not owned by a foreign adversary.

Mehdi, another shop owner, telling me we are making just enough not to die. Now, many here largely blaming the state of the economy on U.S. sanctions. And, you know, Rachel, so many Iranians we've spoken to here stress to us that the anger they feel towards the West is directed at the U.S. government, making that distinction between American policies and the American people.

According to the report, Israeli citizens suffered, quote, brutal sexual assaults that were carried out, quote, systematically and deliberately by Hamas terrorists. The report notes that most victims were killed after or during rape. According to the ARCCI, men, women, and children were all victims of gruesome sexual assault on October 7th. And there is some brutality listed in this report that I can't even say on social media given how gruesome it is. This report was based on several survivors' eyewitness testimony of what happened on October 7th, especially at the massacre at the Nova Music Festival in Southern Israel. The ARCCI is an umbrella organization for nine regional rape crisis centers in Israel, and it's the only organization in the country whose goal is to combat sexual violence. If you don't take this time to condemn what happened, you are part of the problem.

7328150610589568298,"This is wild, right now the state of Texas is going against the federal government in order to secure their border from illegal migrants and as of now 24 states stand with Texas. For the past 3 years there have been a record number of illegal immigrants that have crossed the border of Texas. Governor Greg Abbott asked the federal government for help to secure the border and when he realized he was not going to get that help he started building his own border protection including using razor wire. Then just a few weeks ago the federal government and the Biden administration sued the state of Texas and won the Supreme Court decision allowing the federal government to cut the razor wire. Greg Abbott the governor of Texas then put out a statement saying that they are not going to listen to the Supreme Court or the federal government and are going to continue to secure their border because that is their constitutional right. Yesterday Governor Abbott released this statement stating that the federal government has broken the compact between the United States and the states. Going on to say that President Biden has violated his oath to faithfully execute the immigration laws enacted by Congress. He also states that James Madison, Alexander Hamilton and the other visionaries who wrote the U.S. Constitution foresaw that states should not be left to the mercy of a lawless president. Oklahoma and Florida were two of the first states to state that they stand with Texas. Now all of the states in red have made a public statement saying that they are behind Texas and want Texas to have the right to secure the border. You also have Mike Johnson the Speaker of the House standing with Texas as well. Where do you stand? As always let me know what you think about all of this down below. "

7343292827151142190,"Now Trump won the nomination, but he might lose the general election if he doesn't win over this one group. Super Tuesday was incredible for Trump. He won 14 out of the 15 states against Nikki Haley and by a massive margin. It was so bad for Nikki that she ended up dropping out of the race the very next morning, making Trump the official Republican nominee. However, when analyzing the results, something interesting was revealed. You see, the path for Trump to win the general election should have been clear as American voter support for Joe Biden has been quickly diminishing over the years. But the results from Super Tuesday say this Trump-Biden rematch might be very close. And that's because of this one particular group. Amongst the former Nikki Haley supporters, there is a certain group of people who can be Republicans, Democrats, or Independents, but they all have something in common. They just do not like Trump. However, they're a big group, meaning whoever they choose to support in what is predicted to be a close general election will likely be the winner. "

I used to have these all the time growing up, especially in the wintertime, and they're way better than any hash brown is. So I start off by grating some potatoes and make sure to squeeze out all the liquid, set that aside, and put my potatoes in a bowl with some grated up onion, nutmeg, some eggs, and give that a really good mix. Then I take my bowl with the potato water and make sure to drain all that water off and keep the starch at the bottom, which I add to my potatoes alongside some baking powder just to make it a little bit more crispy. Then these need to be eaten with applesauce, nothing else. So I started making my applesauce by cutting up some honey crisp apples and adding them to my pot with some water and whatever sweetener you want. I use some maple syrup. Once they're really soft, I blend them up and there you go. You have your applesauce. I formed the grated potatoes into little patties, fried them off, and then served them alongside that warm applesauce, and these were so, so good. "

7349920185622580526,"Very breaking news. The country of Russia has launched a munition over Polish airspace. Everyone's worst nightmare. Now, here's what's happening. The munition lasted about 39 seconds over the most eastern part of Poland and the munition was tracked the entire time by Polish air defense. So, what exactly does this mean? Well, what it means is that Russia is not afraid to launch a munition over NATO territory. Second, the munition, after 39 seconds, headed back into Ukraine towards its intended target. So, again, I do want to make clear and not cause this fear amongst you that Poland was tracking this munition the entire time and the fact that they never took it out of the sky, they must have never really seen it as a threat. Again, this was pretty much on the most eastern part of Poland. So, it's not out of the question that sometimes maybe a helicopter might fly through their airspace, a munition might fly over their airspace, but again, Poland didn't even see this as a valid threat, but it is being indicated throughout the world that this is a legitimate thing that happened. Russian munition does fly over Polish airspace, not the greatest thing to hear. "

7349979866198183214,president of Ukraine is very mad at Russia right now. Here's what's going on. Essentially the president of Ukraine is saying that Russia is trying to put the blame on them for the attacks that occurred at the music venue that had very devastating effects such as 140 people losing their lives. So here's what's happening. The president of Russia put out a public statement and addressed to his nation saying that we know that the 11 suspects that we arrested were heading back to Ukraine. Furthermore the leader of Russia said this that there there were people in Ukraine who were ready to receive the 11 suspects who did the attack. Now of course Ukraine is taking this as are you expecting us to think that we knew about these random 11 guys crossing into our country and we were the ones who are going to take them in after they did that attack on your own country. So again there's some really weird things going on between the two countries and a lot of people are pointing to Russia to use this as a crutch to further escalate the conflict in Ukraine because the leader of Russia has already said he's ready to amp it up if he finds out exactly who knew about this.

7350070189922258219,"If TikTok gets banned in the U.S., couldn't we all just download VPNs and access TikTok from servers in other countries? Yes and no. For those of us that are technical, like myself, there will always be a way to beat the system. However, you have to understand what this bill is actually going to do. If ByteDance does not divest, or in other words, sell TikTok to an American company, it will become illegal for companies like Google or Apple to have TikTok in their app stores. This will also include companies that host their websites in America. So what about a VPN? Couldn't I just connect to a server in, say, Switzerland and then download the app? Well, that's not the way the app store works. Both Apple and Google have technology to identify when you're trying to use a VPN to beat the system. And because hosting the software in America will become illegal, you won't be able to download the APKs here in America. Now, with all that being said, for the 90% of Americans that don't know anything about technology, a ban on TikTok is basically game over. But for the more technologically advanced, yes, there are ways around it. However, TikTok updates, what, three, four times a month? So even if you were able to connect to a server and download the APK and then sideload or just install it, you've got to do it a lot. And it's going to get annoying.

For Catherine and Andrew Vies, February 11th, 2023 was shaping up to be a nice relaxing day at the park. Catherine and Andrew just walking their dog when they spot something off in the distance. But as they got closer, the scene took a dark turn. The teenager was actually hovering over a body and he wasn't alone. There was this teenage girl with him and the moment Catherine and her husband tried to step in, both of them bolted. The paramedics rushed in just five minutes later and they pulled out all the stops, but it was too late. Her name was Brianna Jai. By 4.02 PM it was all over. She was one of those people who just lit up a room, you know? And yeah, she was also proudly transgender. School was a bit of a tough crowd for her, but when it came to Tik Tok, she was in her element. Scarlett Jenkinson's story starts off pretty picture perfect. Her mom was shaping young minds as a teacher. Her dad was running his own building and plastering company. She was the baby of the family with three siblings ahead of her. Growing up, she was all about pony rides and getting dolled up for any fancy occasion. But as the years ticked by, Scarlett started to hit some rough patches. By the time she was 11, anxiety had her in a vice grip. To deal with it, she turned to something drastic, cutting herself. Scarlett had a lot of secrets, although you'd never know it to look at her. She was quiet in class, never gave her parents or teachers too much trouble, but that wasn't the real her. If you knew her like Eddie knew her, you'd find out she was much, much darker than she seemed. She met Eddie Ratcliffe at school when they were both 11. He was weird, she thought, but she was weird too. Eddie was sandwiched in the middle of his family with a little sister and a big brother. His outlet was kickboxing in his dad's gym. The kid was so good, he even represented the UK in the sport. By 8th grade, Scarlett was calling herself a satanist and texting Eddie things like, I'll stab your nan and shag your cat. For her, it was just a laugh. For him, that was just Scarlett. "

The chairman of the Joint Chiefs telling me today that the nine retaliatory strikes the U.S. has already carried out against the Houthis are designed so as not to cause a wider war. When you walk this fine line of not wanting it to escalate, what would you say to those people who are your critics, who would say, look, they're not being tough enough on these militants. They're not being tough enough on Iran. I would also ask them if they want a broader conflict, do you want us in a full-scale war? That's the goal of security, to deter them. We don't want to go down a path of greater escalation. We want a broader conflict. What is clear tonight is that deterrence is thus far not working. And in fact, these attacks on commercial ships are only getting worse. "

First, she starts off with MediCube's Vitamin C and niacinamide pads to target dark spots and areas of pigmentation. Next up is a toner by The Lab. It's hyaluronic acid toner with low molecular mass, meaning the smaller size can allow for deep absorption into the skin for maximum hydration from the toner. Pat, pat, pat into the skin. Now my mom's using MediCube's Deep Vitamin C serum. One drop on each cheek before using the MediCube facial device all over her face. Her words verbatim is make circles. My mom says the machine works the product into the face better. She's leaving no face crevice behind here. Next is more juice for the face. She's using a serum in Korean, unclear of the name or brand. Of course, we can't forget under the eyes. Here she's using MediCube's Deep Reviving Peptide Eye Cream. She says to make sure to turn down the level when using the device under your eyes because it's more sensitive. Lastly, she tops off all the juiciness with MediCube's Collagen Jelly Cream all over her face. Disclaimer, she does not do this routine every single night. All done, nice and plump. "

We have these wonderful students, they're going to school, all of a sudden they no longer have a seat, they're no longer invited to the school. We're putting migrants in who don't speak the language, they have no idea what the teacher is saying.

7353319417305910571,"Excuse me, ma'am, quick question for you. Is this your G-Wagon? It is. And what do you do for living out in Las Vegas to be able to afford a G-Wagon? I have an Airbnb business. Now, how long have you been a business owner for? About three years. And over these last three years, what's been the most amount of money that you've ever made in a single year? From my businesses last year, we made almost $7 million. $7 million. Have you ever been broke before? I have, yes. I definitely have. When I used to be a nanny, COVID hit, and so all my jobs were like, oh, we don't really need you anymore. But at the time, I had bills to pay, I had all of these expenses, and I was down to like my last $20 bill. But, you know, you just have to figure it out. How old are you now? 21. And how old were you when you became a millionaire? 20. 20 years old? Yeah. You became a millionaire at 20? Yeah. How did that happen? Seriously, that's incredible. Yeah, thank you so much. It was actually unreal. Still, like today, I don't know if I fully processed it, but we found success with Airbnb very quickly, and when we saw that it was successful, for us, it was just like, it's a numbers game. The more we scale, the more money we'll make. Do you come from money? No, no, not at all. Now, for somebody who may be broke right now, or somebody at rock bottom, what is an actionable step that they can take to get really serious about becoming successful and financially free like yourself? I think a lot of people also think that they need a ton of cash to start businesses, but like even for me, before I started Airbnb, I didn't know that business credit was a thing, and so I would say a lot of people are scared, like when they make a little bit of money, they want to keep the money, but normally you have to actually reinvest it back into the business. I took my money, and I rent an Airbnb, and I have to pay the landlord every month, but because I do that, guests pay me more than what I'm paying the landlord. If you find something that you can scale and continue scaling, that amount of money you can make is unlimited. You have amazing advice. Thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate that. Thank you. "

But we're going to do it, and in this I agree with the Americans. We're going to do it while providing safe passage for the civilian population so they can leave. You've directed the Israeli defense forces to evacuate Rafah in advance of this ground invasion. There's an estimated 1.4 million people in that area right now. And as the German foreign minister said, they can't just disappear. Where are they supposed to go? No, well, the areas that we've cleared north of Rafah are plenty of areas there. But we are working out a detailed plan to do so. And that's what we've done up to now. We're not cavalier about this. This is part of our war effort to get civilians out of harm's way. It's part of Hamas's effort to keep them in harm's way. But we've so far succeeded, and we're going to succeed again. Those who say that under no circumstances should we enter Rafah are basically saying, lose the war. Keep Hamas there. "

I want to quote you back to you and tell us what you meant. You have said divorce is not an option. Right. Our two countries have to live together. And this, I think, is the greatest tension in the U.S.-China relationship. China is our most significant competitor, and at the same time, China is our third-largest trade partner, 750,000 American jobs at stake, agriculture. China is the largest market for U.S. agriculture. One-fifth of all of our export products from agriculture are sent to China. That was $40.9 billion last year. So we can't afford, really, to have a real break here. Well, it's complicated. It's complicated. Some people are saying, well, we're so competitive with China, we should end the economic relationship.

7329613573301325098,"As you know, yesterday, three U.S. servicemembers were killed and dozens of personnel were injured from a one-way attack unmanned aerial system that impacted a U.S. military facility located in northeastern Jordan near the Syrian border. The names of those soldiers who lost their lives were Sergeant William Rivers, Specialist Kennedy Sanders, and Specialist Breonna Moffitt, all of whom were assigned to the 718th Engineer Company, a U.S. Army reserve unit based out of Fort Moore, Georgia. These three fallen heroes were deployed to Jordan in support of Operation Inherent Resolve and the international coalition working to ensure the lasting defeat of ISIS. These brave Americans and their families are in our prayers, and the entire Department of Defense mourns their loss. We also pray for the speedy recovery of those who were injured. Eight personnel who received injuries required medical evacuation from Jordan to the Baghdad Diplomatic Support Center. Three of those patients are scheduled for imminent transport to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center for follow-on care. The other five have been assessed for mild TBIs and are expected to return to duty. We are still assessing what happened and how a one-way attack drone was able to impact the facility. U.S. Central Command continues to investigate this attack, and for operations security and force protection reasons, we're not going to discuss further specifics or measures we're taking to prevent such actions or future attacks. But we do know that Iran-backed militias are responsible for continued attacks on U.S. forces in the region. And as the President and the Secretary have stated, we will not tolerate continued attacks on American forces, and we will take all necessary actions to defend U.S. military men and women forward deployed. And we will do so at a time and place of our choosing. "
